But according to a House Democratic aide, it looks like we also know who the second-worst person is as well. It turns out that when Comey sent his now-infamous letter announcing that the FBI was looking into emails that may be related to Hillary Clintons email server, the ranking Democrats on the relevant committees didnt hear about it from Comey. They found out via a tweet from one of the Republican committee chairmen. \nAs we now know, Comey notified the Republican chairmen and Democratic ranking members of the House Intelligence, Judiciary, and Oversight committees that his agency was reviewing emails it had recently discovered in order to see if they contained classified information. Not long after this letter went out, Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz set the political world ablaze with this tweet. FBI Dir just informed me, \"The FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.\" Case reopened \n Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) October 28, 2016 \nOf course, we now know that this was not the case . Comey was actually saying that it was reviewing the emails in light of an unrelated casewhich we now know to be Anthony Weiners sexting with a teenager. But apparently such little things as facts didnt matter to Chaffetz. The Utah Republican had already vowed to initiate a raft of investigations if Hillary winsat least two years worth, and possibly an entire terms worth of them. Apparently Chaffetz thought the FBI was already doing his work for himresulting in a tweet that briefly roiled the nation before cooler heads realized it was a dud. \nBut according to a senior House Democratic aide, misreading that letter may have been the least of Chaffetz sins. That aide told Shareblue that his boss and other Democrats didnt even know about Comeys letter at the timeand only found out when they checked Twitter. Democratic Ranking Members on the relevant committees didnt receive Comeys letter until after the Republican Chairmen. In fact, the Democratic Ranking Members didn receive it until after the Chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Jason Chaffetz, tweeted it out and made it public. \nSo lets see if weve got this right. The FBI director tells Chaffetz and other GOP committee chairmen about a major development in a potentially politically explosive investigation, and neither Chaffetz nor his other colleagues had the courtesy to let their Democratic counterparts know about it. Instead, according to this aide, he made them find out about it on Twitter. \nThere has already been talk on Daily Kos that Comey himself provided advance notice of this letter to Chaffetz and other Republicans, giving them time to turn on the spin machine. That may make for good theater, but there is nothing so far that even suggests this is the case. After all, there is nothing so far that suggests that Comey was anything other than grossly incompetent and tone-deaf. \nWhat it does suggest, however, is that Chaffetz is acting in a way that makes Dan Burton and Darrell Issa look like models of responsibility and bipartisanship. He didnt even have the decency to notify ranking member Elijah Cummings about something this explosive. If that doesnt trample on basic standards of fairness, I dont know what does. \nGranted, its not likely that Chaffetz will have to answer for this. He sits in a ridiculously Republican district anchored in Provo and Orem; it has a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+25, and gave Mitt Romney a punishing 78 percent of the vote in 2012. Moreover, the Republican House leadership has given its full support to Chaffetz planned fishing expedition. But that doesnt mean we cant turn the hot lights on him. After all, he is a textbook example of what the House has become under Republican control. And he is also the Second Worst Person in the World.

Flynn","text":"Ever get the feeling your life circles the roundabout rather than heads in a straight line toward the intended destination? [Hillary Clinton remains the big woman on campus in leafy, liberal Wellesley, Massachusetts. Everywhere else votes her most likely to don her inauguration dress for the remainder of her days the way Miss Havisham forever wore that wedding dress.  Speaking of Great Expectations, Hillary Rodham overflowed with them 48 years ago when she first addressed a Wellesley graduating class. The president of the college informed those gathered in 1969 that the students needed no debate so far as I could ascertain as to who their spokesman was to be (kind of the like the Democratic primaries in 2016 minus the   terms unknown then even at a Seven Sisters school). I am very glad that Miss Adams made it clear that what I am speaking for today is all of us   the 400 of us, Miss Rodham told her classmates. After appointing herself Edger Bergen to the Charlie McCarthys and Mortimer Snerds in attendance, the    bespectacled in granny glasses (awarding her matronly wisdom   or at least John Lennon wisdom) took issue with the previous speaker. Despite becoming the first   to win election to a seat in the U. S. Senate since Reconstruction, Edward Brooke came in for criticism for calling for empathy for the goals of protestors as he criticized tactics. Though Clinton in her senior thesis on Saul Alinsky lamented Black Power demagogues and elitist arrogance and repressive intolerance within the New Left, similar words coming out of a Republican necessitated a brief rebuttal. Trust, Rodham ironically observed in 1969, this is one word that when I asked the class at our rehearsal what it was they wanted me to say for them, everyone came up to me and said Talk about trust, talk about the lack of trust both for us and the way we feel about others. Talk about the trust bust. What can you say about it? What can you say about a feeling that permeates a generation and that perhaps is not even understood by those who are distrusted? The trust bust certainly busted Clintons 2016 plans. She certainly did not even understand that people distrusted her. After Whitewater, Travelgate, the vast   conspiracy, Benghazi, and the missing emails, Clinton found herself the distrusted voice on Friday. There was a load of compromising on the road to the broadening of her political horizons. And distrust from the American people   Trump edged her 48 percent to 38 percent on the question immediately prior to Novembers election   stood as a major reason for the closing of those horizons. Clinton described her vanquisher and his supporters as embracing a lie, a con, alternative facts, and a   assault on truth and reason.  She failed to explain why the American people chose his lies over her truth. As the history majors among you here today know all too well, when people in power invent their own facts and attack those who question them, it can mark the beginning of the end of a free society, she offered. That is not hyperbole.  Like so many people to emerge from the 1960s, Hillary Clinton embarked upon a long, strange trip. From high school Goldwater Girl and Wellesley College Republican president to Democratic politician, Clinton drank in the times and the place that gave her a degree. More significantly, she went from idealist to cynic, as a comparison of her two Wellesley commencement addresses show. Way back when, she lamented that for too long our leaders have viewed politics as the art of the possible, and the challenge now is to practice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible possible.  Now, as the big woman on campus but the odd woman out of the White House, she wonders how her current station is even possible. Why arent I 50 points ahead? she asked in September. In May she asks why she isnt president. The woman famously dubbed a congenital liar by Bill Safire concludes that lies did her in   theirs, mind you, not hers. Getting stood up on Election Day, like finding yourself the jilted bride on your wedding day, inspires dangerous delusions.","label":0,"_deepnote_index_column":1},{"id":2,"title":"Why the Truth Might Get You Fired","author":"Consortiumnews.com","text":"Why the Truth Might Get You Fired October 29, 2016 \nThe tension between intelligence analysts and political policymakers has always been between honest assessments and desired results, with the latter often overwhelming the former, as in the Iraq War, writes Lawrence Davidson. \nBy Lawrence Davidson \nFor those who might wonder why foreign policy makers repeatedly make bad choices, some insight might be drawn from the following analysis. The action here plays out in the United States, but the lessons are probably universal. \nBack in the early spring of 2003, George W. Bush initiated the invasion of Iraq. One of his key public reasons for doing so was the claim that the countrys dictator, Saddam Hussein, was on the verge of developing nuclear weapons and was hiding other weapons of mass destruction. The real reason went beyond that charge and included a long-range plan for regime change in the Middle East. President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney receive an Oval Office briefing from CIA Director George Tenet. Also present is Chief of Staff Andy Card (on right). (White House photo) \nFor our purposes, we will concentrate on the belief that Iraq was about to become a hostile nuclear power. Why did President Bush and his close associates accept this scenario so readily? \nThe short answer is Bush wanted, indeed needed, to believe it as a rationale for invading Iraq. At first he had tried to connect Saddam Hussein to the 9/11 attacks on the U.S. Though he never gave up on that stratagem, the lack of evidence made it difficult to rally an American people, already fixated on Afghanistan, to support a war against Baghdad. \nBut the nuclear weapons gambit proved more fruitful, not because there was any hard evidence for the charge, but because supposedly reliable witnesses, in the persons of exiled anti-Saddam Iraqis (many on the U.S. governments payroll ), kept telling Bush and his advisers that the nuclear story was true. \nWhat we had was a U.S. leadership cadre whose worldview literally demanded a mortally dangerous Iraq, and informants who, in order to precipitate the overthrow of Saddam, were willing to tell the tale of pending atomic weapons. The strong desire to believe the tale of a nuclear Iraq lowered the threshold for proof . Likewise, the repeated assertions by assumed dependable Iraqi sources underpinned a nationwide U.S. campaign generating both fear and war fever. \nSo the U.S. and its allies insisted that the United Nations send in weapons inspectors to scour Iraq for evidence of a nuclear weapons program (as well as chemical and biological weapons). That the inspectors could find no convincing evidence only frustrated the Bush administration and soon forced its hand. \nOn March 19, 2003, Bush launched the invasion of Iraq with the expectation was that, once in occupation of the country, U.S. inspectors would surely find evidence of those nukes (or at least stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons). They did not. Their Iraqi informants had systematically lied to them. \nSocial and Behavioral Sciences to the Rescue? \nThe various U.S. intelligence agencies were thoroughly shaken by this affair, and today, 13 years later, their directors and managers are still trying to sort it out  specifically, how to tell when they are getting true intelligence and when they are being lied to. Or, as one intelligence worker has put it, we need  help to protect us against armies of snake oil salesmen.  To that end the CIA et al. are in the market for academic assistance. Ahmed Chalabi, head of the Iraqi National Congress, a key supplier of Iraqi defectors with bogus stories of hidden WMD. \nA partnership is being forged between the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), which serves as the coordinating center for the sixteen independent U.S. intelligence agencies, and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine . The result of this collaboration will be a  permanent Intelligence Community Studies Board to coordinate programs in social and behavioral science research [that] might strengthen national security . \nDespite this effort, it is almost certain that the social and behavioral sciences cannot give the spy agencies what they want  a way of detecting lies that is better than their present standard procedures of polygraph tests and interrogations. But even if they could, it might well make no difference, because the real problem is not to be found with the liars. It is to be found with the believers. \nThe Believers \nIt is simply not true, as the ODNI leaders seem to assert, that U.S. intelligence agency personnel cannot tell, more often than not, that they are being lied to. This is the case because there are thousands of middle-echelon intelligence workers, desk officers, and specialists who know something closely approaching the truth  that is, they know pretty well what is going on in places like Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Israel, Palestine and elsewhere. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper (right) talks with President Barack Obama in the Oval Office, with John Brennan and other national security aides present. (Photo credit: Office of Director of National Intelligence) \nTherefore, if someone feeds them snake oil, they usually know it. However, having an accurate grasp of things is often to no avail because their superiors  those who got their appointments by accepting a pre-structured worldview  have different criterion for what is true than do the analysts. \nListen to Charles Gaukel, of the National Intelligence Council  yet another organization that acts as a meeting ground for the 16 intelligence agencies. Referring to the search for a way to avoid getting taken in by lies, Gaukel has declared,  Were looking for truth. But were particularly looking for truth that works.  Now what might that mean? \nI can certainly tell you what it means historically. It means that for the power brokers, truth must match up, fit with, their worldview  their political and ideological precepts. If it does not fit, it does not work. So the intelligence specialists who send their usually accurate assessments up the line to the policy makers often hit a roadblock caused by group think, ideological blinkers, and a we know better attitude. \nOn the other hand, as long as what youre selling the leadership matches up with what they want to believe, you can peddle them anything: imaginary Iraqi nukes, Israel as a Western-style democracy, Saudi Arabia as an indispensable ally, Libya as a liberated country, Bashar al-Assad as the real roadblock to peace in Syria, the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) aka Star Wars, a world that is getting colder and not warmer, American exceptionalism in all its glory  the list is almost endless. \nWhat does this sad tale tell us? If you want to spend millions of dollars on social and behavioral science research to improve the assessment and use of intelligence, forget about the liars. What you want to look for is an antidote to the narrow-mindedness of the believers  the policymakers who seem not to be able to rise above the ideological presumptions of their class  presumptions that underpin their self-confidence as they lead us all down slippery slopes. \nIt has happened this way so often, and in so many places, that it is the source of Shakespeares determination that what is past, is prelude. Our elites play out our destinies as if they have no free will  no capacity to break with structured ways of seeing. Yet the middle-echelon specialists keep sending their relatively accurate assessments up the ladder of power. Hope springs eternal.","label":1,"_deepnote_index_column":2},{"id":3,"title":"15 Civilians Killed In Single US Airstrike Have Been Identified","author":"Jessica Purkiss","text":"Videos 15 Civilians Killed In Single US Airstrike Have Been Identified The rate at which civilians are being killed by American airstrikes in Afghanistan is now higher than it was in 2014 when the US was engaged in active combat operations.   Photo of Hellfire missiles being loaded onto a US military Reaper drone in Afghanistan by Staff Sgt. Brian Ferguson/U.S. Air Force. \nThe Bureau has been able to identify 15 civilians killed in a single US drone strike in Afghanistan last month  the biggest loss of civilian life in one strike since the attack on the Medecins Sans Frontieres hospital (MSF) last October. \nThe US claimed it had conducted a counter-terrorism strike against Islamic State (IS) fighters when it hit Nangarhar province with missiles on September 28. But the next day the United Nations issued an unusually rapid and strong statement saying the strike had killed 15 civilians and injured 13 others who had gathered at a house to celebrate a tribal elders return from a pilgrimage to Mecca. \nThe Bureau spoke to a man named Haji Rais who said he was the owner of the house that was targeted. He said 15 people were killed and 19 others injured, and provided their names (listed below). The Bureau was able to independently verify the identities of those who died. \nRais son, a headmaster at a local school, was among them. Another man, Abdul Hakim, lost three of his sons in the attack. \nRais said he had no involvement with IS and denied US claims that IS members had visited his house before the strike. He said: I did not even speak to those sort of people on the phone let alone receiving them in my house. \nThe deaths amount to the biggest confirmed loss of civilian life in a single American strike in Afghanistan since the attack on the MSF hospital in Kunduz last October, which killed at least 42 people. \nThe Nangarhar strike was not the only US attack to kill civilians in September. The Bureaus data indicates that as many as 45 civilians and allied soldiers were killed in four American strikes in Afghanistan and Somalia that month. \nOn September 18 a pair of strikes killed eight Afghan policemen in Tarinkot, the capital of Urozgan provice. US jets reportedly hit a police checkpoint, killing one officer, before returning to target first responders. The use of this tactic  known as a double-tap strike  is controversial because they often hit civilian rescuers. \nThe US told the Bureau it had conducted the strike against individuals firing on and posing a threat to Afghan forces. The email did not directly address the allegations of Afghan policemen being killed. \nAt the end of the month in Somalia, citizens burnt US flags on the streets of the north-central city of Galcayo after it emerged a drone attack may have unintentionally killed 22 Somali soldiers and civilians. The strike occurred on the same day as the one in Nangarhar. \nIn both the Somali and Afghan incidents, the US at first denied that any non-combatants had been killed. It is now investigating both the strikes in Nangarhar and Galcayo. \nThe rate at which civilians are being killed by American airstrikes in Afghanistan is now higher than it was in 2014 when the US was engaged in active combat operations.

Here are the six pictures of sharks Sir Elton John likes to stare at to pass the time on an airplane. 1. A Shark Swimming \nSit next to Elton John on a flight and youll see a man living in the lap of luxury, as he immediately tapes this photo of a shark darting through the ocean over his window to stare at throughout the trip. The platinum-selling artist has been known to pull his window shade down to make the shark disappear, and then quickly retract it to mark the animals triumphant return. He will often repeat this act dozens of times per flight. 2. A Great White Shark Leaping Into The Air \nWhen youre an international pop sensation worth an estimated $450 million, people go the extra mile to make you happy. Flight crews are instructed to place this photo of a breaching great white in Elton Johns seat-back pocket before he even boards the plane. The five-time Grammy winner loves to pull the image out at his leisure to stare at while flying, sometimes holding it a mere 3-to-4 inches away from his face while he fixates upon the sharks beady eyes. 3. A Shark On The Prowl \nRumor has it Elton John first acquired this shark photo in 1997, just before flying to London to perform Candle In The Wind at Princess Dianas funeral. Its been a staple of his travel routine ever since. Those who have flown with the music legend say that Sir Elton turns on every single overhead light in his row to study this picture with a magnifying glass. 4. Two Hammerhead Sharks \nHow does the man behind Tiny Dancer and Rocket Man handle turbulence as his plane traverses the Atlantic? Once that Fasten Seat Belts sign lights up, this picture of two hammerhead sharks comes out. Elton John holds the photo in a tight vice grip and stares straight at it until the turbulence passes, often without blinking for minutes at a time. 5. The Poster For Jaws \nSir Elton John absolutely adores the poster for Steven Spielbergs Jaws and hopes to one day see the film. In the meantime, the British icon makes do by slowly unfolding his 24-by-36-inch copy of the poster whenever hes on a long flight, gently tracing the sharks teeth with his finger as he stares lovingly into its gaping mouth. 6. Pilots Choice \nAs much as Elton relishes in the calming regularity of his shark picture rotation, he also loves the excitement of gazing upon a totally unexpected shark when flying from London to a distant corner of Europe. Thats why all pilots who fly Sir Elton print out a shark picture of their choice from their home computers before going to the airport, and hand it to the visibly excited musician prior to takeoff. So yeahits good to be Elton!","label":1,"_deepnote_index_column":6},{"id":7,"title":"Benot Hamon Wins French Socialist Partys Presidential Nomination - The New York Times","author":"Alissa J. Rubin","text":"PARIS     France chose an idealistic, traditional   candidate in Sundays primary to represent the Socialist and   parties in the presidential election this spring. The candidate, Benot Hamon, 49, who ran on the slogan that he would make Frances heart beat, bested Manuel Valls, the former prime minister, whose campaign has promoted more   policies and who has a strong    background. Mr. Hamon appeared to have won by a wide margin, with incomplete returns showing him with an estimated 58 percent of the vote to Mr. Vallss 41 percent. Tonight the left holds its head up high again it is looking to the future, Mr. Hamon said, addressing his supporters. Our country needs the left, but a modern, innovative left, he said. Mr. Hamons victory was the clearest sign yet that voters on the left want a break with the policies of President Franois Hollande, who in December announced that he would not seek  . However, Mr. Hamons strong showing is unlikely to change widespread assessments that   candidates have little chance of making it into the second round of voting in the general election. The first round of the general election is set for April 23 and the runoff for May 7. The Socialist Party is deeply divided, and one measure of its lack of popular enthusiasm was the relatively low number of people voting. About two million people voted in the second round of the primary on Sunday, in contrast with about 2. 9 million in the second round of the last presidential primary on the left, in 2011. However, much of the conventional wisdom over how the elections will go has been thrown into question over the past week, because the leading candidate, Franois Fillon, who represents the main   party, the Republicans, was accused of paying his wife large sums of money to work as his parliamentary aide. While nepotism is legal in the French political system, it is not clear that she actually did any work. Prosecutors who specialize in financial malfeasance are reviewing the case. Frances electoral system allows multiple candidates to run for president in the first round of voting, but only the top two   go on to a second round. Mr. Hamon is entering a race that is already crowded on the left, with candidates who include   Mlenchon on the far left, and Emmanuel Macron, an independent who served as economy minister in Mr. Hollandes government and who embraces more   policies. Unless he decides to withdraw, Mr. Fillon, the mainstream right candidate, will also run, as will the extreme right candidate Marine Le Pen. The two have been expected to go to the runoff. Mr. Hamons victory can be attributed at least in part to his image as an idealist and traditional leftist candidate who appeals to union voters as well as more environmentally concerned and socially liberal young people. Unlike Mr. Valls, he also clearly distanced himself from some of Mr. Hollandes more unpopular policies, especially the economic ones. Thomas Kekenbosch, 22, a student and one of the leaders of the group the Youth With Benot Hamon, said Mr. Hamon embodied a new hope for those on the left. We have a perspective we have something to do, to build, Mr. Kekenbosch said. Mr. Hollande had disappointed many young people because under him the party abandoned ideals, such as support for workers, that many   voters believe in, according to Mr. Kekenbosch. Mr. Hollandes government, under pressure from the European Union to meet budget restraints, struggled to pass labor code reforms to make the market more attractive to foreign investors and also to encourage French businesses to expand in France. The measures ultimately passed after weeks of strikes, but they were watered down and generated little concrete progress in improving Frances roughly 10 percent unemployment rate and its nearly 25 percent youth joblessness rate. Mr. Hamon strongly endorses a stimulus approach to improving the economy and has promised to phase in a universal income, which would especially help young people looking for work, but would also supplement the livelihood of   French workers. The end goal would be to have everyone receive 750 euros per month (about $840). We have someone that trusts us, Mr. Kekenbosch said, who says: I give you enough to pay for your studies. You can have a scholarship which spares you from working at McDonalds on provisional contracts for 4 years.  Mr. Hamon advocates phasing out diesel fuel and encouraging drivers to replace vehicles that use petroleum products with electrical ones. His leftist pedigree began early.

Trump is scheduled to make a highly anticipated visit to an   church in Detroit on Saturday, the first such visit of his campaign. There, he will participate in a    session conducted by Bishop Wayne T. Jackson of the church, Great Faith Ministries International. Given the importance of the visit, the Trump team went so far as to script Mr. Trumps answers to Bishop Jacksons questions, which were submitted in advance. After this article was published on Thursday night, a campaign official said that Mr. Trump would also speak to the churchs congregation and then tour some neighborhoods with Ben Carson, a former presidential candidate and Detroit native. Below are excerpts from a draft of the script that was obtained by The New York Times. _____ Mr. Trump there is racial divide in our country and it is evident that the tension is boiling over. Case and point Reverend Pinckney in South Carolina was gunned down when a white young man came into their Bible Study and slaughtered the Reverend and eight other individuals because he wanted to start a race war. What would your administration do to bring down the racial tension that is in our Country? In the Bible Jesus said that a house divided cannot stand. Our best hope for erasing racial tensions in America is to work toward a   society. In business, we hire, retain and award based on merit. In society, however, we have divisions that can only be eliminated if we have equal opportunity and then equal access to programs and institutions that will lift all people in the country. We have to reform our tax system so that we can spur economic growth for the long haul. We have to have stronger enforcement of immigration laws. We have to renegotiate our trade deals so that we can bring advantage back to the American workforce. But perhaps most important is that we must provide equal opportunity for a quality education for all Americans. The higher the educational attainment, the greater the likelihood one can climb the economic ladder. We must bring school choice programs to our cities and we must get rid of Common Core. We must make sure that access, affordability and accountability are brought into our higher education system. Without a focus on educational outcomes for every American, we will perpetuate the permanent underclass that progressive policies have sustained. Republicans like me need to have the courage to speak the truth about where we are and what has to be done. We have to have the courage to go into communities and work with everyone there to make sure that our schools are good and that our children have access to the whatever educational situation they may need. This is not something one person can do, but it is something that we can do together. _____ Mr. Trump there is a perception that your administration is racist. With many of the African American voters their belief is that the Republican Party as a whole does not cater to African American needs. In 2008 and 2012 we had two Republican Candidates John McCain and Mitt Romney and neither one of them came to Detroit, or any urban area that I can remember to even address the concerns of our community. First I would like to commend you for coming to our community as a Republican Candidate. Second I need to know how would you change that perception in our community? The proof, as they say, will be in the pudding. Coming into a community is meaningless unless we can offer an alternative to the horrible progressive agenda that has perpetuated a permanent underclass in America. We need to be true to our word and offer all Americans more opportunities so that each and every one of them can reach their full potential. This means economic policies that will bring jobs back to America and will raise wages for all. This means working hard to provide as many educational options as possible to our parents and children. This means cleaning up drugs and making our neighborhoods and communities safer. We need to get people off welfare and back to work. We need to make sure that anyone who qualifies can go into a bank, get a loan and then start a business. We need to reduce regulations and expand options for people who want to be independent of government. We need to make sure that people can worship how they want and where they want without worrying that some federal agency is going to threaten the religious liberties. Republicans have better options. We just need to have the courage to present them with conviction. _____ Mr. Trump what is your vision for America? And specifically Black America? If you repeal Obama care what is your plan to provide health care and medicine to those who cant afford it, yet need it the most? As President, I must serve all Americans without regard to race, ethnicity or any other qualification. I must approach my task with the utmost wisdom and make sure that all Americans have opportunities to achieve to their potential. If we are to Make America Great Again, we must reduce, rather than highlight, issues of race in this country. I want to make race disappear as a factor in government and governance. Every individual, regardless of race or ethnicity, must have access to the full array of opportunities in America. My vision for America is that every citizen and legal resident of this nation will be able to stand side by side and be proud of the fact that they live in the greatest nation on earth. As for the Affordable Care Act, I will work to repeal the act and replace it with market driven solutions that will offer more access to healthcare at more affordable prices. Every American should be able to purchase health insurance across state lines, have health savings account that belong to them, have price transparency so they can shop for the best services at the best prices and know that they will not have to compete with those who are clogging the system simply because they are in this country illegally. We want to block grant Medicaid so that states can provide services closer to the people. We want to make sure that every American has great economic opportunity so that they can seek out their own health insurance and still be able to afford it. This approach will serve all Americans and will ensure that more Americans are covered by better insurance and healthcare options. _____ Mr. Trump I am a registered Democrat but I am an undecided voter in this election for 2016. It is not only myself but there has been a lot of Pastors and African Americans who have not made up their minds concerning who they are going to cast their vote for. The latest polls indicate that you have 1 percent of the African American vote. What can you say to undecided voters such as myself and others in the African American Community that will win our vote on November 8, 2016? And beyond winning, why is the African American vote important to you? All votes are important to me and my campaign. Your vote, your neighbors vote, the vote of every American is critical and I must do all I can to make sure you know that if you vote for me, you are voting for a stronger, more vibrant America. My policies offer you a clear choice. You can continue down the road of progressivism that has created a permanent underclass in this country that, unfortunately, includes far too many people of color. If you want a better America, you must break from the historical hold that Democrats have had on people of color and move to options that allow you to achieve your potential. This is all about opportunity     not   outcomes and promises of things to come that never materialize. The progressives have worked tirelessly to bring all Americans down to one level rather than allowing as many as possible to rise as high as possible. Education, jobs, religious liberty and protection of civil rights are the promises that I will keep, not just utter to gain favor. If you are interested in a greater America with more opportunity, liberty and prosperity, you must take a chance and walk over to my side. If you want a strong partner in this journey, you will vote for me. I will never let you down. By the way, my support is now up to 8% and climbing.","label":0,"_deepnote_index_column":8},{"id":9,"title":"A Back-Channel Plan for Ukraine and Russia, Courtesy of Trump Associates - The New York Times","author":"Megan Twohey and Scott Shane","text":"A week before Michael T. Flynn resigned as national security adviser, a sealed proposal was   to his office, outlining a way for President Trump to lift sanctions against Russia. Mr. Flynn is gone, having been caught lying about his own discussion of sanctions with the Russian ambassador. But the proposal, a peace plan for Ukraine and Russia, remains, along with those pushing it: Michael D. Cohen, the presidents personal lawyer, who delivered the document Felix H. Sater, a business associate who helped Mr. Trump scout deals in Russia and a Ukrainian lawmaker trying to rise in a political opposition movement shaped in part by Mr. Trumps former campaign manager Paul Manafort. At a time when Mr. Trumps ties to Russia, and the people connected to him, are under heightened scrutiny     with investigations by American intelligence agencies, the F. B. I. and Congress     some of his associates remain willing and eager to wade into   efforts behind the scenes. Mr. Trump has confounded Democrats and Republicans alike with his repeated praise for the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, and his desire to forge an   alliance. While there is nothing illegal about such unofficial efforts, a proposal that seems to tip toward Russian interests may set off alarms. The amateur diplomats say their goal is simply to help settle a grueling,   conflict that has cost 10, 000 lives. Who doesnt want to help bring about peace? Mr. Cohen asked. But the proposal contains more than just a peace plan. Andrii V. Artemenko, the Ukrainian lawmaker, who sees himself as a   leader of a future Ukraine, claims to have evidence     names of companies, wire transfers     showing corruption by the Ukrainian president, Petro O. Poroshenko, that could help oust him. And Mr. Artemenko said he had received encouragement for his plans from top aides to Mr. Putin. A lot of people will call me a Russian agent, a U. S. agent, a C. I. A. agent, Mr. Artemenko said. But how can you find a good solution between our countries if we do not talk? Mr. Cohen and Mr. Sater said they had not spoken to Mr. Trump about the proposal, and have no experience in foreign policy. Mr. Cohen is one of several Trump associates under scrutiny in an F. B. I. counterintelligence examination of links with Russia, according to law enforcement officials he has denied any illicit connections. The two others involved in the effort have somewhat questionable pasts: Mr. Sater, 50, a   pleaded guilty to a role in a stock manipulation scheme decades ago that involved the Mafia. Mr. Artemenko spent two and a half years in jail in Kiev in the early 2000s on embezzlement charges, later dropped, which he said had been politically motivated. While it is unclear if the White House will take the proposal seriously, the diplomatic freelancing has infuriated Ukrainian officials. Ukraines ambassador to the United States, Valeriy Chaly, said Mr. Artemenko is not entitled to present any alternative peace plans on behalf of Ukraine to any foreign government, including the U. S. administration.  At a security conference in Munich on Friday, Mr. Poroshenko warned the West against appeasement of Russia, and some American experts say offering Russia any alternative to a    international agreement on Ukraine would be a mistake. The Trump administration has sent mixed signals about the conflict in Ukraine. But given Mr. Trumps praise for Mr. Putin, John Herbst, a former American ambassador to Ukraine, said he feared the new president might be too eager to mend relations with Russia at Ukraines expense     potentially with a plan like Mr. Artemenkos. It was late January when the three men associated with the proposed plan converged on the Loews Regency, a luxury hotel on Park Avenue in Manhattan where business deals are made in a lobby furnished with leather couches, over martinis at the restaurant bar and in private conference rooms on upper floors. Mr. Cohen, 50, lives two blocks up the street, in Trump Park Avenue. A lawyer who joined the Trump Organization in 2007 as special counsel, he has worked on many deals, including a   tower in the republic of Georgia and a   mixed martial arts venture starring a Russian fighter. He is considered a loyal lieutenant whom Mr. Trump trusts to fix difficult problems. The F. B. I. is reviewing an unverified dossier, compiled by a former British intelligence agent and funded by Mr. Trumps political opponents, that claims Mr. Cohen met with a Russian representative in Prague during the presidential campaign to discuss Russias hacking of Democratic targets. But the Russian official named in the report told The New York Times that he had never met Mr. Cohen. Mr. Cohen insists that he has never visited Prague and that the dossiers assertions are fabrications. (Mr. Manafort is also under investigation by the F. B. I. for his connections to Russia and Ukraine.) Mr. Cohen has a personal connection to Ukraine: He is married to a Ukrainian woman and once worked with relatives there to establish an ethanol business. Mr. Artemenko, tall and burly, arrived at the Manhattan hotel between visits to Washington. (His wife, he said, met the first lady, Melania Trump, years ago during their modeling careers, but he did not try to meet Mr. Trump.) He had attended the inauguration and visited Congress, posting on Facebook his admiration for Mr. Trump and talking up his peace plan in meetings with American lawmakers. He entered Parliament in 2014, the year that the former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych fled to Moscow amid protests over his economic alignment with Russia and corruption. Mr. Manafort, who had been instrumental in getting Mr. Yanukovych elected, helped shape a political bloc that sprang up to oppose the new president, Mr. Poroshenko, a wealthy businessman who has taken a far tougher stance toward Russia and accused Mr. Putin of wanting to absorb Ukraine into a new Russian Empire. Mr. Artemenko, 48, emerged from the opposition that Mr. Manafort nurtured. (The two men have never met, Mr. Artemenko said.) Before entering politics, Mr. Artemenko had business ventures in the Middle East and real estate deals in the Miami area, and had worked as an agent representing top Ukrainian athletes. Some colleagues in Parliament describe him as corrupt, untrustworthy or simply insignificant, but he appears to have amassed considerable wealth. He has fashioned himself in the image of Mr. Trump, presenting himself as Ukraines answer to a rising class of nationalist leaders in the West. He even traveled to Cleveland last summer for the Republican National Convention, seizing on the chance to meet with members of Mr. Trumps campaign. Its time for new leaders, new approaches to the governance of the country, new principles and new negotiators in international politics, he wrote on Facebook on Jan. 27. Our time has come! Mr. Artemenko said he saw in Mr. Trump an opportunity to advocate a plan for peace in Ukraine     and help advance his own political career. Essentially, his plan would require the withdrawal of all Russian forces from eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian voters would decide in a referendum whether Crimea, the Ukrainian territory seized by Russia in 2014, would be leased to Russia for a term of 50 or 100 years. The Ukrainian ambassador, Mr. Chaly, rejected a lease of that kind. It is a gross violation of the Constitution, he said in written answers to questions from The Times. Such ideas can be pitched or pushed through only by those openly or covertly representing Russian interests.  The reaction suggested why Mr. Artemenkos project also includes the dissemination of kompromat, or compromising material, purportedly showing that Mr. Poroshenko and his closest associates are corrupt. Only a new government, presumably one less hostile to Russia, might take up his plan. Mr. Sater, a longtime business associate of Mr. Trumps with connections in Russia, was willing to help Mr. Artemenkos proposal reach the White House. Mr. Trump has sought to distance himself from Mr. Sater in recent years. If Mr. Sater were sitting in the room right now, Mr. Trump said in a 2013 deposition, I really wouldnt know what he looked like.  But Mr. Sater worked on real estate development deals with the Trump Organization on and off for at least a decade, even after his role in the stock manipulation scheme came to light. Mr. Sater, who was born in the Soviet Union and grew up in New York, served as an executive at a firm called Bayrock Group, two floors below the Trump Organization in Trump Tower, and was later a senior adviser to Mr. Trump. He said he had been working on a plan for a Trump Tower in Moscow with a Russian real estate developer as recently as the fall of 2015, one that he said had come to a halt because of Mr. Trumps presidential campaign. (Mr. Cohen said the Trump Organization had received a letter of intent for a project in Moscow from a Russian real estate developer at that time but determined that the project was not feasible.) Mr. Artemenko said a mutual friend had put him in touch with Mr. Sater. Helping to advance the proposal, Mr. Sater said, made sense. I want to stop a war, number one, he said. Number two, I absolutely believe that the U. S. and Russia need to be allies, not enemies. If I could achieve both in one stroke, it would be a home run.  After speaking with Mr. Sater and Mr. Artemenko in person, Mr. Cohen said he would deliver the plan to the White House. Mr. Cohen said he did not know who in the Russian government had offered encouragement on it, as Mr. Artemenko claims, but he understood there was a promise of proof of corruption by the Ukrainian president. Fraud is never good, right? Mr. Cohen said. He said Mr. Sater had given him the written proposal in a sealed envelope. When Mr. Cohen met with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office in early February, he said, he left the proposal in Mr. Flynns office. Mr. Cohen said he was waiting for a response when Mr. Flynn was forced from his post. Now Mr. Cohen, Mr. Sater and Mr. Artemenko are hoping a new national security adviser will take up their cause. On Friday the president wrote on Twitter that he had four new candidates for the job.","label":0,"_deepnote_index_column":9},{"id":10,"title":"Obamas Organizing for Action Partners with Soros-Linked Indivisible to Disrupt Trumps Agenda","author":"Aaron Klein","text":"Organizing for Action, the activist group that morphed from Barack Obamas first presidential campaign, has partnered with the   Indivisible Project for online trainings on how to protest President Donald Trumps agenda. [Last week, Breitbart News extensively reported that Indivisible leaders are openly associated with groups financed by billionaire George Soros.  Politico earlier this month profiled Indivisible in an article titled, Inside the protest movement that has Republicans reeling.   The news agency not only left out the Soros links, but failed to note that the organizations cited in its article as helping to amplify Indivisibles message are either financed directly by Soros or have close ties to groups funded by the billionaire, as Breitbart News documented. Organizing for Action (OFA) is a   community organizing project that sprung from Obamas 2012 campaign organization, Organizing for America, becoming a nonprofit described by the Washington Post as advocate[ing] for the presidents policies.  In a recent Facebook post titled, Take a deep breath. Then take action, OFA called on constituents to lobby particularly hard between now and February 26, when lawmakers will be in their home districts. The post included a link to a guide released by Indivisible on how to organize against Trump. Stay tuned for online trainings and invitations to calls with coalition partners like Indivisible Guide, the OFA post states. Paul Sperry, writing at the New York Post, relates: The manual, published with OFA partner Indivisible, advises protesters to go into halls quietly so as not to raise alarms, and grab seats at the front of the room but do not all sit together.  Rather, spread out in pairs to make it seem like the whole room opposes the Republican hosts positions. This will help reinforce the impression of broad consensus.  It also urges them to ask hostile questions     while keeping a firm hold on the mic     and loudly boo the the GOP politician if he isnt giving you real answers.  Express your concern [to the events hosts] they are giving a platform to   authoritarianism, racism, and corruption, it says.       Even the safest [Republican] will be deeply alarmed by signs of organized opposition, the document states, because these actions create the impression that theyre not connected to their district and not listening to their constituents.  Sperry reported OFA plans to stage 400 rallies across 42 states this year to attack Trump and Republicans over ObamaCares repeal.  Earlier this month, NBC News reported on OFAs new actions and its partnership with Indivisible: OFA has hired 14 field organizers in states home to key senators as part of its campaign to defend Obamas signature healthcare law. To run that campaign, the group hired Saumya Narechania     the former national field director at Enroll America, which worked to sign people up for Obamacare     and a deputy campaign manager.       OFA says more than 1, 800 people have applied to its Spring Community Engagement Fellowship, a   training program,   of whom have not previously been involved with OFA. And the group has teamed up with Indivisible, a buzzy newcomer to the progressive movement, to offer organizing training that began Thursday night with a video conference. A combined 25, 000 people have registered to participate in those trainings, OFA said. Indivisibles DC branch was implicated in a scuffle last week that reportedly injured a    staffer for Rep. Dana Rohrabacher ( ) as well as reportedly knocking a    to the ground.  Protesters claimed they were only delivering Valentines Day cards. Indivisible is a part of a coalition of activist groups slated to hold a massive   Tax March in Washington and at least 60 other locations on April 15. Unreported by the news media is that most of the listed partners and support organizers of the march are openly financed by Soros or have close links to Soros financing, as Breitbart News documented last week. Meanwhile, earlier this month, Politico profiled Indivisible and reported that conservatives are spreading unfounded rumors that the group is being driven by wealthy donors like George Soros.  Politico, however, seemingly failed to do even the most minimal research on the Indivisible leaders cited in the news outlets own profile.  Some of those personalities are openly associated with groups financed by Soros. Politico further failed to note that the organizations cited in its article as helping to amplify Indivisibles message are either financed directly by Soros or have close ties to groups funded by the billionaire. Citing Angel Padilla, a   of the group, Politico reported: Dubbed Indivisible, the group launched as a way for Padilla and a handful of fellow   aides to channel their   heartbreak into a manual for quashing President Donald Trumps agenda. They drafted a   protest guide for activists, full of pointers on how to bird dog their members of Congress in the language of Capitol insiders. The manual has since been downloaded over one million times. Indivisible says on its website that over 4, 500 local groups across the nation have signed up to resist the Trump agenda in nearly every congressional district in the country.  The manual has been utilized to form the basis of a protest movement. The groups website states: Whats more, you all are putting the guide into action   showing up en masse to congressional district offices and events, and flooding the congressional phone lines. Youre resisting   and its working.  Politico reported on unfounded rumors being spread about Soross involvement with Indivisible (emphasis added by this reporter): Its handful of senior leaders count about 100 contributors to their national organizing work but insist that all are working on a volunteer basis. They know conservatives are spreading unfounded rumors that their success is being driven by wealthy donors like George Soros, which they flatly deny. That paragraph was followed by the following quote from   Padilla (emphasis again added by this reporter): It doesnt matter who we take money from     were always going to get blamed as a Soros group, even if we dont take money from Soros, said Padilla, now an analyst with the National Immigration Law Center. Thats one of the attacks and thats fine.  While Indivisible has yet to disclose its donors, Politico failed to inform readers that the National Immigration Law Center where the news outlet reported Padilla serves as an analyst is financed by Soross Open Society Foundations. The Center has received numerous Open Society grants earmarked for general support. Also unmentioned by Politico is that Padilla previously served as an immigration policy consultant at the radical National Council of La Raza. Soros is a major La Raza donor. Politico went on to detail how Indivisible has been aided by MoveOn. org and the ACLU.  The news website failed to tell readers that MoveOn. org and the ACLU are both financed by Soros, a relevant tidbit given Politicos claim about unfounded rumors that Indivisibles success was being driven by Soros .  The news website reported: In addition, MoveOn. org and the Working Families Party joined with Indivisible for its first nationwide call on Jan. 22. Nearly 60, 000 people phoned in that day, according to Levin and MoveOn organizing director Victoria Kaplan. Indivisible estimates that its second national call, on the impact of Trumps immigration order with assistance from the ACLU and Padillas group, drew 35, 000 people. Politico also missed that, according to its Twitter account, another organizer of the conference call with MoveOn. org was the International Refugee Assistance Project, a project of the Urban Justice Center, another recipient of an Open Society grant. Taryn Higashi, executive director of the Centers International Refugee Assistance Project, currently serves on the Advisory Board of the International Migration Initiative of Soross Open Society Foundations. Politico further reported on Indivisibles ties to the organizers of last months   Womens March while failing to mention that Soros reportedly has ties to more than 50 partners of that march. Also, this journalist first reported on the march leaders own close associations with Soros. Regarding Indivisible and the Womens March, Politico reported: Indivisible is also embracing collaboration with other major   protest outlets. Leaders of the group were in communication with Womens March organizers before their main event on Jan. 21, and that partnership will become official when the March unveils the third in its series of 10 direct actions that attendees have been asked to pursue in their communities. Another Indivisible leader mentioned in the Politico article is Jeremy Haile. Not reported by Politico is that is Haile served as federal advocacy counsel for the Sentencing Project.  The Sentencing Project is reportedly financed by Soross Open Society Foundations, which has also hosted the Project to promote its cause.

Some believe that Nazi Germany, under the control of Adolf Hitler, possessed supernatural powers, and largely employed pseudo-science during the 1933-1945 period. However, some also hold that the above belief is just a mere speculation without any proven fact. Over the years, researchers have searched extensively for answers to some of the more mysterious activities associated with Nazi Germany.\nNazi Germany invaded Russia (formerly the USSR) during the Second World War on June 22, 1941. At the time, the German army progressed deep into Russian territory, gaining ground close to the capital Moscow, before the Russians could counter-attack, eventually driving the Nazis back.\nDuring the Nazi occupation in Russia, in 1942, the Nazis built a secret military base around the Arctic, code-named Schatzgraber or Treasure Hunter, which was reportedly very instrumental in the war against Russia. The base was primarily used as a tactical weather station for planning the strategic movements of Nazi troops, warships and submarines. The base also housed eminent Nazi scientists, whom conducted many experiments to help progress a German win of the war. It was widely speculated at the time that the Nazis used the base to contact aliens or extraterrestrial beings. The controversial Ahnenerbe was even linked to the base. The Ahnenerbe was an institute in Nazi Germany. Responsible for researching archaeological and cultural history of the Aryan race, it is rumored to have had heavy occult influences. Founded on July 1, 1935, by Heinrich Himmler, Herman Wirth and Richard Walther Darr, the Ahnenerbe later conducted experiments and launched expeditions in attempts to prove that mythological Nordic populations had once ruled the world.\nHowever, the Nazis abandoned the base in 1944  a time when the Russian army began its offensive, pushing the Germans out of the country. According to a war-time story, supplies had dwindled to dangerously low levels, and the Nazi officers stationed at the base outpost were forced to kill and eat polar bear, which ultimately, was infected with trichinosis. This caused those stationed at the base to fall severely ill and eventually they required rescue by a German U-boat. Despite Russian authors telling the story of Treasure Hunter, some observers consider it a myth, doubting its existence.\nBut Russian researchers have now announced that Treasure Hunter has been discovered, saying the base is on the island of Alexandra Land in the Arctic Circle, located 620 miles from the North Pole.\nA senior researcher at the Russian Arctic National Park, Evgeny Ermolov said in a statement announcing the discovery : Before it was only known from written sources, but now we also have real proof.","label":1,"_deepnote_index_column":12},{"id":13,"title":"US Officials See No Link Between Trump and Russia","author":"Jason Ditz","text":"Clinton Campaign Demands FBI Affirm Trump's Russia Ties   \nWith the 2016 election campaign winding down, the Clinton campaign is ratcheting up demands for the FBI to publicly confirm the campaigns allegations that Republican nominee Donald Trump is secretly in league with Russia.

The calls have grown since Fridays FBI report to Congress about further Clinton emails being sought. \nWith Clintons main campaign scandal growing in the waning weeks of the deal, some in her campaign have suggested that affirming Trump as secretly in league with the Russians would only be fair.

For years, many have suspected that government trolls have been systematically causing havoc all over the Internet, but proving it has been difficult. But now thanks to documents leaked by Edward Snowden and revealed by Glenn Greenwald, we finally have hard evidence that western governments have been doing this. As you will see below, a UK intelligence outfit known as the Government Communications Headquarters, through a previously secret unit known as the Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group, has been systematically attempting to control, infiltrate, manipulate, and warp online discourse. This should be deeply disturbing to anyone that values free speech on the Internet. \nIt isnt just that the British government is trying to influence what people are thinking. The reality is that this is far bigger than a mere propaganda campaign. As Greenwald recently noted on his new website , the integrity of the Internet itself is at stake \nBy publishing these stories one by one, our NBC reporting highlighted some of the key, discrete revelations: the monitoring of YouTube and Blogger , the targeting of Anonymous with the very same DDoS attacks they accuse hacktivists of using, the use of  honey traps  (luring people into compromising situations using sex) and destructive viruses . But, here, I want to focus and elaborate on the overarching point revealed by all of these documents: namely, that these agencies are attempting to control, infiltrate, manipulate, and warp online discourse , and in doing so, are compromising the integrity of the internet itself. \nSo what techniques are the British using to control and manipulate discourse on the Internet? According to Greenwald, the documents that Snowden has uncovered show that they are willing to sink to despicable lows in order to get the results that they desire \nAmong the core self-identified purposes of JTRIG are two tactics: (1) to inject all sorts of false material onto the internet in order to destroy the reputation of its targets; and (2) to use social sciences and other techniques to manipulate online discourse and activism to generate outcomes it considers desirable. To see how extremist these programs are, just consider the tactics they boast of using to achieve those ends:  false flag operations  (posting material to the internet and falsely attributing it to someone else), fake victim blog posts (pretending to be a victim of the individual whose reputation they want to destroy), and posting  negative information  on various forums. \nThe following is a list of Internet infiltration techniques that were listed on one particular slide that Snowden leaked \n Infiltration Operation \n Sting Operation \nYou can check out this slide for yourself right here . \nThere is also evidence that the Canadian government has been involved in this sort of thing as well.   Natural News  \nYouve probably run into them before  those seemingly random antagonizers who always end up diverting the conversation in an online chat room or article comment section away from the issue at hand, and towards a much different agenda. Hot-button issues like illegal immigration, the two-party political system, the war on terror and even alternative medicine are among the most common targets of such attackers, known as internet trolls or shills, who in many cases are nothing more than paid lackeys hired by the federal government and other international organizations to sway and ultimately control public opinion . \nSeveral years ago, Canadas CTV News aired a short segment about how its own government had been exposed for hiring secret agents to monitor social media and track online conversations, as well as the activities of certain dissenting individuals. This report, which in obvious whitewashing language referred to such activities as the government simply  weighing in and correcting  allegedly false information posted online, basically admitted that the Canadian government had assumed the role of secret online police . \nYou can see a video news report about this activity up in Canada right here . \nAre you disturbed yet? \nYou should be. \nSo what kind of people are the governments of the western world targeting online? \nWell, when it comes to the U.S. government, all you have to do is to look at their official documents to see who they consider the problems to be. For much more on this, please see my previous article entitled  72 Types Of Americans That Are Considered Potential Terrorists In Official Government Documents . \nSadly, the reality of the matter is that the days of the free and open Internet are numbered. The governments of the world are increasing their control over the Internet with each passing day, and eventually a time will likely come when we will not be able to communicate openly like this any longer. \nThings have gotten so bad in the U.S. already that even Google is spooked  \nA recent court decision that endorsed a broad view of the Federal Communications Commissions authority over the Internet has Google and other Web companies nervous. \nIn closed-door meetings with regulators and Capitol Hill staff, Googles lawyers have said theyre worried how the FCC may use its newfound powers, according to multiple people familiar with the meetings. \nThe extent of the FCCs authority over Google and other Web services remains unclear, and the current FCC has given no indication that it is interested in pushing aggressive new regulations. But the possibility that the commission could begin telling Google how to organize its search results or handle its users data is enough to spook the companys army of Washington lobbyists. \nAnd this is just the beginning. \nIf you think that the control freaks that are running things now are bad, just wait until you see the next generation of control freaks. \nFor example, there is one prominent student writer at Harvard that apparently believes that free speech at her university should be abolished and that any professor that does not advocate for her politically-correct version of justice should be fired  \nA student writer at Harvard University is raising eyebrows after publishing her belief that free speech on campus should be abolished and professors with opposing views be fired. \nSandra Korn, a senior who writes a column for the Harvard Crimson newspaper, thinks radical leftism is the only permissible political philosophy, and the First Amendment only hinders colleges from brainwashing students with her viewpoint. \nLets give up on academic freedom in favor of justice, states the subtitle of her Feb. 18 column , in which she insists Harvard stop guaranteeing students and professors the right to hold controversial views and conduct research putting liberalism in a negative light. \nIf our university community opposes racism, sexism, and heterosexism, why should we put up with research that counters our goals? Korn asks. \nThis is what control freaks always want. \nThey always want to shut down those that are presenting opposing views. \nThey dont believe in free speech and a marketplace of ideas. Rather, they believe in shoving what they believe down the rest of our throats. \nAnd now we have solid proof that the governments of the western world are paying people to manipulate discourse on social media, blogs, forums and websites. \nSo will there be great outrage over this, or will the apathetic public just roll over and ignore this like they have so many other times the past few years? \nMy guess, most will just roll over and ignore this. People dont care. Hammerstrike \nAt least I know why people disagree with me other dem intrenets now, they are paid trolls! Paid by the governement to spread falsehoods and hurt muh feelins! seth datta \nMost of my comments get deleted by bankster paid control freaks if they dont troll my comments. Banksters truly are the psychopaths destroying the world. K \nThe amazing thing is, they are not that hard to spot. But since like so many other things, people will not face the truth. This information will only help a very few. For those of you still sitting on the fence. How much more evidence do you need? How many more ways does the Government have to mess with you? What will it finally take, to say enough? Rodster \nDont confuse me with the facts. I already made up my mind. SupernaturalCat \nThe amazing thing is, they are not that hard to spot. But since like so many other things, people will not face the truth. \nIndeed. Never underestimate the power of denial. DJohn1 \nThis is called doing anything for a paycheck. Otherwise known in the world as prostituting for money. Snowden probably has a few other surprises in the material he has not released yet. This also dates back to way before the internet was ever thought of. PR firms for the government have been making fun of anything that they truly want to hide. Such as any legitimate UFO reporting over the last 50 or so years. Anyone with a thorough knowledge of Solar System Astronomy was made to feel like a nut as far back as the 50s. One Russian Scientist came up with a fantastic theory of how Venus came to be where it is in the Solar System. In 1949 or 1950 scientists all over the planet wanted his books banned from publication and actually boycotted anyone that would pub his work. His theory said that Venus was extremely hot(800 degrees Fahrenheit). That the planet had a weird rotation. That it possibly came into the Solar System around the time of Joseph of Egypt and 400 years later caused the plagues of Egypt under Moses. That placed it in BIblical times. Well Venus does have a weird day. It is longer than its year. Venus is full of hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide. It has an atmosphere much thicker than the Earths. All of which sort of lend credit to the theory. It is volcanic and has a very hot surface. In 1950, astronomers were guessing that Venus was a twin to Earth with a slightly higher temperature. Possibly 150 at the equator and comfortable at the poles. Then the Russian Drones sent to Venus told an entirely different story and blew all of the astronomers out of the water. I hope I am embarrassing them for their efforts to ban the man from publication. He spent his years at Princeton University after leaving Russia. Two aspects of the theory should make us all sit up and listen. He claimed the Hydrocarbons rained oil over the surface of the Earth and that might be where a lot of Earths supply of oil came from. The Russians are acting on that theory to find new oil reserves. The second aspect is that Venus played a kind of bounce game as it came down through the Solar System and removed the second planet from the Sun in the process and dumped it out further in the Solar System. He thought that Mars was originally in the orbit where Venus is today. His theory was that mankind forgot what happened in a kind of national amnesia. IF what he says was true, then Mars could have had a thick enough atmosphere and water to support life! More important it might have had a thick magnetic layer that filtered out the Sun and kept the planet temperate at one time. All of which was ruined as Venus dragged it out of orbit. That might have happened in biblical times. The Earth might have been slightly closer to the Sun with a 360 day year instead of 365 and a quarter day year. This of course is all speculation until we go out there and find out the real truth of what is going on. My own guess is that if there is life on Mars it is in caves under the surface with a slightly heavier atmosphere and possibly seas in these huge caverns. If there is any surface life left, it is likely to be about the size of a dog or a racoon. If there is large life, I suspect it will be Sand Worms deep in the sands of Mars. I mention this because it is very easy to ridicule ideas. The one I just told you about actually happened in the 50s and was ridiculed coast to coast by actual scientists. We are in a universe with over 100 billion galaxies out there. The number of stars with life possible is at a fantastic number. If one in a million stars has life, that is still a whole lot of life out there. The only explanation that makes sense to me is we are far off the trade lanes between the stars. Otherwise we would have been contacted years ago. Or have we been? I suggest that when a civilization reaches the level of using Atomic Bombs then that civilization bares watching. We had a lot of UFO activity after World War II and the setting off of bombs all over the planet as governments tested these weapons. Governments all over the world that are big enough are probably hiding a lot of things from all of us. I think we might all be amazed at just exactly what has been withheld. NowAlive \nThis is quite a postulation on the mere evidence that was correct, namely the temperature of Venus. The plagues of Egypt were localized. You had firstborns killed unless you used a passover lamb. Second, what about the oils raining down all over the Earth? I was quite young when Valdez crashed. The oil rig explosion in the Gulf is more recent. The hydrocarbon dumping would have killed off most life on the planet. Basically my point is that observational science shows that virtually none of what you just stated has been proven or even has any legitimate evidence. Its wild speculation. Im not an astrophysicist, but I doubt you are either. The governments hiding things is obvious. This in no way shows life on Mars or Venus dumping oil or switching orbital positions. It does not even slightly point to alien visitations or life. Im not trying to offend you. Im just trying to understand what you just said in a way that shows there is some evidence for it. DJohn1 \nYou are quite right. It is wild speculation on my part. Except the temperature is not the only evidence. Venus rotates the wrong direction in its spin or day. It is the only planet in the entire solar system to do so. The day is 268 of our days long. The year is 222 of our days. That the temperatures are so high could just be the closeness to the Sun. The atmosphere is 15 times thicker than our planets atmosphere. That speaks to me that something unusual is going on. As for the oil, it is showing up in places that only a rain of oil might explain. The critical thing that we do not know is When it occurred or if it occurred at all. If I am right, there is a good possibility that the Moon will have some fairly large deposits of oil under the surface. There is a lot of unexplained discoloration on face of the Moon. If there is oil under the surface of the Moon, it might also mean that the Moon was a small planet at one time with an atmosphere and life. Again, I am speculating. The theory did not come from astrophysics. It came from examining a lot of stories all over the planet from the approximate time of Moses. That was Velinkovskys specialty, ancient languages and psychology of ancient cultures. Rastus \nA field of study that you may or may not have heard of is called catastrophism. Not without its critics and highly controversial among biblical scholars, you may find the subject a good scratch to your itch. A book by Donald Wesley Patten called Catastrophism And The Old Testament might be in accordance with your fancy. Johnny \nAre you speaking of Immanuel Velikovsky? He is the Author of Worlds in Collision. He points out the chaos of the universe. I found him interesting to read in 1958. DJohn1 \nYes. He was not a specialist in astronomy. He simply pointed out what the beliefs of the ancient world were. He did upset the scientific world of his time. I think he was at least 50% right about things. We now know that Venus could not have come from Jupiter or Saturn. My own thought is that it had to come from the outer solar system or beyond. We have well over 100 moons around the planets. Most of which are around the gas giants. Most of which have a nickel/iron core. None of which could have come from the major gas giants in the Solar System. They had to come from something much more dense and much older. The man most likely to shake the core beliefs of astrophysics and astronomy is an accomplished astronomer, Dr. Mike Brown. What he is finding is there are a series of small, Pluto sized planets, some with small moons in the outer solar system. Scientists have been looking in the wrong place. Of the four new planets he has found, they seem to be 40-50 degrees off the orbits of the gas giants. Some are in extremely comet like orbits and at least one is on its way out of the Solar System. I am no scientist. A lot of what I read about it makes little sense with current theories. Unless there is something out there that is big enough to drag small planets and moons out of their original orbits around the Sun. Some think we have a brown dwarf about a light year out at the edge of the Suns influence(gravity). So far no one has found it. I think we are looking in the wrong places. IF there is a brown dwarf, it is quite small as stars go. IF it is in a comet-like orbit, then somewhere down the road it will return causing all kinds of changes in the Solar System. IF it has planets around it, then those planets might cause a lot of destruction as they come close to existing planets and moons in our solar system. Our planets as viewed from the North and top of the Solar System rotate around the Sun counter-clockwise. IF this brown dwarf is rotating clockwise around the Sun, that might complicate finding and plotting an orbit for it. IF it is way off the angle that most planets orbit the Sun, that might also keep it from being discovered. I do find it interesting that a lot of astronomy telescopes are moving towards the South Pole for observations. Known Brown Dwarf Stars do exist around stars in our stellar neighborhood and some are independent of any other stars all within about 12 light years of our Sun. A lot of what we do know is kept fairly low key and doesnt really get a lot of news headlines. How many people know about Dr. Browns work in the outer solar system? How many know about the gap(hole) in the orbits of the ORB cloud? A gap big enough for something the size of Venus or much larger could have made in the outer asteroid belt. I think it is possible that an object possibly the size of a gas giant might be out there somewhere but so little light is coming from it that we will only discover it by accident. What is significant is we are still learning about new planets in our own solar system. The governments have spent enormous amounts of money in this area through NASA. So someone must think we have things out there we need to know. GrimReaperLady \nI found your reply facinating! There is no way we are the only planet with life. I think I am going to go read some scientific journals, any suggestions. jaxon64 \nAwesome distraction techniqueyou turned a discussion of govt media control and trolling into a lengthy discussion of planetary formation?truly masterful. You deserve a raise. DJohn1 \nThank you. Just for the record, I have no salary from the U.S. Government for trolling. The only funds from them I see is my monthly Social Security Check as someone that has retired. Not sure how long that lasts before they steal what they havent all ready spent out of the general fund. The true masters are the PR people hired to keep the sheep all sleeping peacefully while the government steals everything in sight. I started getting suspicious about 20 years ago, when the entire newspaper business stopped mud raking and went with bland stories handed out by the wire services. It appears stirring up things has legal penalties and newspapers do not want to get hung up in legal battles. So they run news from wire services and leave the real reporting to others. Making advertisers angry has financial penalties as well, so lord help the reporter that angers an advertiser. Everything is wrapped up in money motivations. That above anything else is what has destroyed the countrys estate that used to bring down the crooked politicians. The only way this related to planetary formation is that this media was used to go against this man by scientists that were angry at his claims. These scientists literally boycotted the publishers willing to pub his work. My own thought is that controling the scientific discovery press is just as bad. Jonathon von Tischner \nA good video on that is Return of the Nephilim by Chuck Missler. DJohn1 \nImmanuel Velikovsky wrote the book in question. Worlds in Collision was the title. He was wrong about a lot of things. For instance I do not think it is possible to have Venus come out of Jupiter. The elements are different. Venus has a heavy core vs Jupiter has a Hydrogen and Helium core. What he did get right was a lot of facts about what Venus actually consisted of. My own idea is Venus might have been a wondering planet not orbiting any Star. I mentioned this man because by coincidence he did get a lot of things right. His ideas should not have been debunked or censored in any way. How was Venus created? I think it might have come from Brown Dwarf that was coming apart at the seams. That would make it a whole lot older than Velinkovsky thought. The idea is Brown Dwarfs might have a lot of heavy materials on them than regular stars and gas planets. We have an entire solar system full of heavy objects like that. We also have at least 4 gas giants that consist mostly of hydrogen and helium. The question is where did all of those heavy material objects consisting of nickel/iron cores come from? That is a question that most astronomy scientists do not have a good answer yet. 2Wurth \nWow, less than two sentences into the article and the icon of Gary2 started appearing on the left and right sides of the screen.

Eric Blair \nThose who propose that only one perspective is viable and that all competing viewpoints should be abolished by decree are the worst trolls of all, no matter what ideals they hold up to justify their actions. America was founded on the idea of freedom, and primarily freedom of speech and ideas.

Goebbels and Bernays would be proud of such people, but they have no place in a truly free country.

NO ONE can read the facts that Michael presents, and logically reach the conclusions he does when faced with pages of data and facts unless they are brain dead or have an agenda. He might have both. Guest \nLOL. I dont think Gary is a disinformation agent. I think hes just an angry man who feels that hes owed something. But thats just my opinion. jaxon64 \nagreednow gay vet may actually be a troll. Gary at least discusses the issues,-albeit from his redundant and close-minded viewpoints which are inalterable by factsyet gay vet and a few others are always trying to distract from the topic and turn any intelligent discourse in the comments section into a name calling and Repub vs Democrat discussion. His very name was probably chosen to distract from article content. Another tactic I see from some here consistently is that if anyone mentions any faith, or God or just finishes a post with God help usthen trolls who never post anything else will pounce in and start attacking GodI think the true motive is to turn the conversation toward one of atheism/religion/creation instead of the topic of the article You see it from the same people over and overthen they disappear and someone new with a different moniker will take their place ( quite possibly the same shill but different name.) All said, they are very effective at distraction if one reads through the comments, they often take over an entire article and it never gets back on topic.

For instance, on YT, they are always a dead give away, as for 95% of the time, they use a First and Last name, which from what i can tell, is autogenerated through some script they use. I had seen in a video, the FedBizOpps site putting out a contract for a system to make multiple IDs for use in some Social Media program. If i recall, it was the Air Force or something like that. Operation Earnest Voice was another one as well. But they basically log in through some front-end of sorts, and they dont actually use YT like we do. The profiles are ALWAYS empty: no dates, no vids, no likes, no uploads, no playlists, nothing on the About section. Its all pure vapor. \nAnd Cass Sunstein was the one who recommended all this in his paper, calling it cognitive infiltration, and who is another Dr Goebbels wanna-be and who should be hung from a tree. And its not like they are going to change our minds on anything. Troll or no troll, if i dont like what youre saying to me, i have 3 words for you Go F yourself. This is what actually enrages me more than anything, that they feel everyone but themselves, are going to be that malleable, zombified and sloth-like, to just believe everything they spew. If its one thing i hate, its people with superiority complexes, they are just a total scourge on the planet and its mindset of every control-freak authoritarian out there, past, present and future. Randall Thrift \nThe illusion of privacy is just that, AN ILLUSION.

Gay Veteran \nsorry junior but I detest our fascist government Charles Reece \nBy the way, since Britain and America are BOTH English-speaking countries  and the closest of allies, along with France; that therefore, England is ALREADY in league with whatever almost EVERTHING that the U.S. does in the first place, AND therefore, given Edward Snowdens revelations of the U.S. Governments intelligence apparatus spying on its own citizens; that accordingly, why not EXPECT Britain to do the same  to not only their OWN people, but also ours as well, anyway. \nAnd besides, truly, during the 1960s, the English-speaking countries; such as England itself, and Canada, Australia, and New Zealand have already been SHARING signals-intelligence information  or electronic eavesdropping information  with each other and with Uncle Sam; through the ECHELON electronic eavesdropping network; which was set up back in 1964. \nBy each member nation of ECHELON electronically spying on each others respective private citizens  and passing on intelligence-gathered information to the OTHER member nations; that consequently, each member nation could actually CIRCUMVENT their own respective governments laws PROHIBITING ECHELON from spying on its OWN countrys citizens. Theyve been doing this ever since ECHELON was set up back in 64. But very few Americans have already known about whats been going on all of these past five decades; that being, with ECHELON members permitting each other to electronically spy and share intelligence information dealing with each others countrys citizens. Thus, by ONE member nation allowing ANOTHER one to gather information on its own citizens  and sharing that same information with the others; that consequently, each member nation COULD NOT legally be accused of violating its own respective governments laws prohibiting domestic spying. BART SIMPSONSON \nHey, its just another means of getting the progs agitprop out there and countering any notion of Free Speech on the internet.

And I dont think its a Lib vs Dem thing, I imagine most governments do it. And its not just governments either. Big business is up to exactly the same thing.

Statistically speaking, he was the 28th when he made his debut for the Columbus Crew in 2007. But Schelottos phone still rings to this day, more than six years after he left the league, with calls from fellow Argentines looking for advice. Though Schelotto, 43, is currently the coach of Boca Juniors, the most decorated team in Argentina, most of the players who call him want to talk about other teams, about other countries, about a soccer world away from the   environment of Buenos Aires. Most of them like to talk about the cities, Schelotto said. Many of them find a way to come. Argentines now make up the   demographic in M. L. S. trailing only Americans. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, going into this seasons openers, 98 Argentine players had been featured in an M. L. S.   game since the leagues inception. Sebastian Blanco, a new designated player for Portland, made his debut in an opener Friday and became No. 99. In a ranking by nationality, Argentines have the   goal total, too. Twelve of the 22 teams in M. L. S. will start the season with at least one Argentine on their roster, a list that includes stars like Dallass Mauro Diaz and Montreals Ignacio Piatti and newcomers like Atlantas Hector Villalba and New York City F. C.s Maxi Moralez. Why do they come? For some its the money, or at least the promise that it will be paid regularly. Others come for the lifestyle, the chance to fade into a comparative anonymity unavailable to them at home, or to live the quiet, clean life that Schelotto describes as he reminisces about his days in Ohio. The Portland Timbers playmaker Diego Valeri was one such player who called Schelotto, his former manager, and he eventually heeded his advice. But he said it was for an entirely different reason. A year before he signed with Portland, while under contract to his hometown club Lanus, Valeri had had a gun pressed to his throat when robbers attempted to steal his BMW with his wife, Florencia, and daughter, Connie, inside. After that moment, Valeri said with considerable understatement, we thought about opportunities to play outside and know different places in the world.  Within a year, Valeri, who had had loan spells in Portugal and Spain, was on his way to Portland. Situations like that are very hard for the Argentinian people to change, he said. The    Valeri and his family are now settled in the Northwest, where he is playing arguably the best soccer of his career. He is a     and in between was named the most valuable player when Portland won the 2015 M. L. S. Cup championship game. I think they like the anonymity and the tranquillity here, Caleb Porter, Valeris coach with the Timbers, said of his star and his countrymen. They really relish the opportunity to be here and to live a lifestyle thats different to how they lived in Argentina. They transition well into M. L. S.  Since 2011, Portland has signed six Argentines, including its   acquisition of Blanco, 28. Valeri has been a good ambassador     he speaks English and urges newcomers to try to learn it as soon as possible, to ease the transition. But Porter and the Timbers general manager and president of soccer, Gavin Wilkinson, believe there is another, more straightforward reason for Argentinas outsize presence in M. L. S.: It simply produces the kind of technical player that the league desires. Certain countries produce certain positions more, Porter said. Most teams are looking for that creative piece, and you know you can get one in Argentina.  A large alumni directory and strong ties to agents and consultants in the region have made that kind of shopping easier for M. L. S. teams, and in the past the struggles of the Argentine economy also favored North American clubs, some said. But there also has been a change in the kind of individual looking to make the move north, and that has dovetailed with the leagues overall transfer policy. As the quality of M. L. S. has improved as it enters its third decade, its teams have looked less for marketability from its imports     which in the past had trended toward aging, often European stars     and more toward onfield impact and value. The latest class of Argentines reflects this shift, as they enter a league where the average age of designated players     the teams   stars     has fallen below 28, its lowest point in a decade. They know that M. L. S. is different to 10 years ago, said Schelotto, who was 34 when he moved to the league. They can go, make good money, play with some pressure. They know they can make a career in the United States and then maybe move to Europe. Ten years ago, it was impossible. Right now, you can.  There are currently 24 Argentines playing in the league. Atlanta United and its Argentine coach, Tata Martino, brought in three ahead of its first season, each of them 25 or younger (Villalba is just 22). Buying young is now seen as more of a benefit to clubs than a risk, as players who continue to develop retain a   value if they move on to brighter prospects in Europe. People are coming here younger and younger, maybe to start their careers, Ignacio Piatti, a    playmaker for the Montreal Impact, said through an interpreter. Its what they are looking for at that age: being able to live a comfortable life off the field and focus on their games.  Piatti, like Schelotto, has been happy to offer advice to the next wave of Argentine talents considering entering M. L. S. including players on both sides of the Hudson River. Gonzalo Veron, 27, of the Red Bulls, and Moralez, 30, who recently signed with New York City F. C. both acknowledged that they had turned to Piatti for advice before signing. At a community event in East Harlem last week, Moralez     who spent four years in Italy     reflected on his decision to move to the United States. He had never been to New York City before signing, he said, and after turning to the likes of Piatti and David Villa for advice about the leagues standard of play, he said he also sought assurances for his family, who are set to join him in New York shortly. First off, I just want to enjoy football, Moralez said. But also to get to know the beauty of the city and the country. Not everybody gets the opportunity to come here.

Stumpf announced his departure from the company, effective immediately. The move was a swift and stunning fall for an executive whose bank made it through the 2008 financial crisis relatively unscathed, only to be undone by a   sales scandal that pervaded its community banking division and percolated under the surface for years. It was an extraordinary moment even in the banking industry, which has been bedeviled by criticism and regular scandals since the financial crisis. Despite the industrys many troubles, relatively few banking chiefs have stepped down under outside pressure. But Wells Fargos transgressions were unusually blatant and straightforward, which contributed to the   public outcry. This time, there were no exotic financial instruments, complicated trades or complex mortgage trickery. The banks misdeeds were fundamentally simple: Under intense pressure to meet aggressive sales goals, employees created sham accounts using the names     and sometimes, the actual money     of the banks real customers. And in some cases the customers did not discover the activity until they started accumulating fees. The reaction to the fake accounts at Wells Fargo, and to Mr. Stumpfs response to what has been uncovered as a widespread problem, has been withering and unrelenting. Wells Fargo has been under fire from irate customers, regulators, lawmakers and former employees since last month, when it disclosed that it would pay $185 million in fines and penalties over the unauthorized creation of as many as two million bank and credit card accounts over a period of at least five years by branch employees who were said to be under intense pressure to hit ambitious product sales goals. The sales practices may reach back far longer. Former bank employees told The New York Times of concerns they raised internally as far back as 11 years ago. Mr. Stumpf, 63, who was twice called in front of Congress to testify about the scandal in recent weeks, faced vocal demands to resign from an outraged public, but the timing of his departure was unexpected given that the Wells Fargo board had not completed its internal investigation into the phony accounts and that the bank reports   earnings on Friday. He potentially walks away with millions of dollars, including a $20 million pension, as of Wednesday, another $4. 3 million in deferred compensation, plus stock worth $109 million, according to data from Equilar. As the scandal erupted, Mr. Stumpf, who grew up on a dairy and poultry farm in Minnesota and had long emphasized his folksy roots, was unable to quell the uproar. Rather, he often seemed to inflame it. During his testimony in front of Congress, Mr. Stumpf said he took responsibility for the problems, but would not admit that there anything wrong with the banks broader culture. When pressed repeatedly by members of the Senate Banking Committee about why he had not given back any of his lavish compensation, Mr. Stumpf insisted that the decision was not up to him, but to the banks board. He was reminded that he was the boards chairman. One senator on the banking committee noted that criticism of the Wells Fargo scandal was one of the few things that Democrats and Republicans had agreed on in a long time. Mr. Stumpfs spent 34 years at a bank that had once been regarded as a darling on Wall Street because of its ability to churn out profits even as other banks struggled. Mr. Stumpf was named chief executive in 2007 and was one of the countrys   bankers, earning about $19 million last year. He was named the 2013 Banker of the Year by the trade publication American Banker. Wells Fargo was once the most valuable bank as measured by the price of its stock, which attracted the billionaire Warren E. Buffett as its largest shareholder. Mr. Buffetts company, Berkshire Hathaway, has a stake of about 10 percent. Mr. Buffett did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. Wells Fargo has since ceded the most valuable bank distinction to JPMorgan Chase. The board received a letter from Mr. Stumpf early on Wednesday indicating that he intended to retire, according to a person briefed on the matter. This person said the board was still in the early stages of conducting its investigation into the fake accounts and Mr. Stumpfs handling of the scandal and had not drawn any conclusions from its inquiry. The board was not scheduled to meet on Wednesday when it received Mr. Stumpfs letter, which this person described as brief and lacking any indication as to why the longtime C. E. O. decided to leave now. Top bank executives were expecting that Mr. Stumpf would address analysts and investors     as he has always done     when Wells Fargo reports its   results on Friday. Wells Fargo said Mr. Stumpf would be replaced by Timothy J. Sloan, its president and chief operating officer. Just two days earlier, the San Francisco bank shuffled its top management to give more responsibility to Mr. Sloan. I am grateful for the opportunity to have led Wells Fargo, Mr. Stumpf said in a written statement. While I have been deeply committed and focused on managing the company through this period, I have decided it is best for the company that I step aside.  Mr. Sloan was informed early Wednesday that he was the banks new C. E. O. though he had known for several days that Mr. Stumpf was preparing to step down. In an interview, Mr. Sloan said Mr. Stumpf had told him of his decision to retire after concluding that he would most likely continue to be the focus of much of the criticism being leveled at the bank. It was an incredibly selfless decision, Mr. Sloan said. Federal regulators and the Los Angeles city attorney began looking into the issue in 2013. The deal Wells Fargo announced last month to settle cases brought by their offices was intended to resolve the matter, but it instead opened the floodgates, provoking a furious outpouring of questions, criticism and new information about what former employees say was a   culture of toxic sales pressure. The Department of Justice and Labor Department opened their own inquiries. Mr. Sloan said the bank had already named a new head of community banking, ended the retail banking sales goals that employees blamed for putting them under undue pressure and extended its review of its sales practices back to 2009. Originally, the banks review covered its activities only between 2011 and 2015. Mr. Sloan will not hold the dual of roles of chief executive and chairman as Mr. Stump had. Mr. Stumpf agreed last month to surrender stock grants valued at $41 million     another highly unusual move on Wall Street, where clawback provisions have been widely adopted but are almost never deployed. Mr. Stumpf said he would give up his $2. 8 million annual salary for the duration of the boards investigation. Because his departure is a resignation, Mr. Stumpf will leave without any severance, according to Oscar Suris, a company spokesman. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who blasted Mr. Stumpf when he appeared before the Senate last month, fired off a scathing statement on Wednesday. As I said at the hearing last month, Mr. Stumpf should resign, return every nickel he made while this scam was going on, and face an investigation by the Justice Department and S. E. C. , she said. So far, hes one for three.

Family members say she was simply an innocent bystander in a clash between police and protesters, and was not guilty of anything the police claimed. \nVia AlternativeNews \n\nJessi Mitchell, of local News 9 reports that family members of Caddo Nation chairwoman Tamara Francis-Fourkiller said an anonymous donor paid $2.5 million late Saturday afternoon to release everyone arrested on Thursday at the Dakota Access Pipeline site.\nThey added, however, that Francis-Fourkiller was never supposed to have been arrested in the first place. An expert on sacred burial grounds , Francis-Fourkiller was one of the tribal leaders visiting the Sioux of Standing Rock to advise them during negotiations with the Dakota Access Pipeline construction team, Mitchell continues. Remains were being desecrated in this pipeline, so they had asked a bunch of people to come up there, so theres a big conference, Francis-Fourkillers sister Loretta Francis explained.\nOn the visit , Francis said her sister and other leaders decided to tour the protest camps. They never thought they would wind up in jail. Francis said her sister had no access to her medication while in custody in Cass County, North Dakota, and now faces charges of conspiracy and rioting. Part of my family was removed on the Trail of Tears and they came here to Oklahoma and they suffered, said Francis. I always feel like each generation  our parents, our grandparents  try to make it better for the next generation and they certainly didnt want this for my sister.\nDozens of Native Americans from Oklahoma tribes had gathered Saturday afternoon at the state Capitol, according to Mitchell, with the purpose of voicing their anger at the treatment of the protesters in North Dakota, pointing out this weeks acquittal of armed protesters at an Oregon wildlife refuge earlier this year.\nWere not holding guns. Were not armed, and when we see the military right here in the US use that on us, its shameful, Comanche Nation tribal council member Sonya Nevaquaya explained.\nOne of the fundamentals of all Native American tribes is the protection of the land. Chanting Water is life! Saturday, the Oklahoma demonstrators hope to rally people from around the country to stand with those in North Dakota and stop construction on the pipeline project. These pipelines, you hear of a lot of bursts and leaks and it contaminating the waters. What happens when all of our waters and resources are gone? Nevaquaya explained. Francis-Fourkiller says she will be traveling back to her home in Norman as soon as possible.\n","label":1,"_deepnote_index_column":17},{"id":18,"title":"FBI Closes In On Hillary!","author":"The Doc","text":"FBI Closes In On Hillary!

Orders from women in Brazil, Ecuador and Venezuela roughly doubled, while those from Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador and Honduras went up by from 36 percent to 76 percent, researchers said in a study published Wednesday by The New England Journal of Medicine. The authors of the study included a leader of the group based in Amsterdam that is supplying the pills, Women on Web, a nonprofit staffed by doctors helping women from countries where abortion is illegal or restricted to terminate unwanted pregnancies. Even with the increase in demand for abortion pills, the number of orders received by Women on Web from Latin America and the Caribbean in that time period was small: slightly more than 2, 300 in the region, with about 1, 600 of those in countries where health authorities had warned about Zikas potential to cause brain damage. In the countries where Zika warnings were issued, there are typically about 3. 5 million abortions per year, said Gilda Sedgh, the principal research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research organization which was not involved in the study. So, Dr. Sedgh said, The increase in demand for abortion observed by the authors in countries affected by Zika could be spurious because Women on Web accounts for a small share of all abortions in that part of the world.  The numbers could be an early warning sign of increased demand for abortion because of Zika, Dr. Sedgh said, adding that it is also possible that Women on Web might have experienced an increase in demand as a result of increased visibility of their services when health advisories were issued.  Access to abortion has been a contentious issue for years in many of the countries affected by Zika, but Zika has brought fresh attention to the debate. In Latin America and the Caribbean, according to a recent study, there are about 6. 5 million abortions each year. Most of them are illegal, and an estimated 750, 000 women a year are treated for complications from unsafe abortions in the region, Dr. Sedgh said. Womens rights groups have long pressed for abortion restrictions to be eased. The study looked at orders for pills between Nov. 17, 2015, when the Pan American Health Organization issued an alert saying Zika virus might be linked to a surge in infants born with tiny heads and damaged brains in Brazil, and March 2 of this year. It compared actual orders to the number that would have been expected based on orders during the previous five years. Women on Web has a history of defying legal restrictions in such countries, which sometimes block access to its website or seize the packages it sends. The nonprofit also asks women unable to pay for their prescription to write an email explaining why they needed the abortion pill and could not afford it. Some of the emails that came in were heartbreaking, said Dr. Abigail R. A. Aiken, a reproductive health researcher at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, Austin, and the lead author of the study. The fear and desperation was really hard to read.  A woman from Venezuela wrote, I contracted Zika 4 days ago, adding: I love children. But I dont believe it is a wise decision to keep a baby who will suffer. I need an abortion. I dont know who to turn to. Please help me ASAP! An email from a woman in Colombia said, Here Zika is a major problem and the health authorities do not help with it.  She added: I have no resources at this time and want to ask for your help because fear overwhelms me. What if the baby is born sick? ! Even more than it has increased attention on restrictive abortion laws, the Zika crisis has highlighted the issues of access to contraception and ways that women are   about birth control or discouraged from using it in some of the countries. In the face of Zika, some countries have been working to increase the availability and use of contraception. Women on Web is an offshoot of Women on Waves, which was founded in 1999 by Dr. Rebecca Gomperts. Women on Waves originally sailed a Dutch boat to countries that outlawed abortion, took women on board and performed abortions outside a nations territorial waters. As internet access in poor countries increased, Dr. Gomperts began supplying mifepristone and misoprostol pills, a combination approved by the World Health Organization for abortion in the first 10 weeks of a pregnancy. The Women on Web site is posted in five languages and tops Google search results for I need an abortion.

The vote is a huge step forward in the campaign to rid the world of nuclear weapons launched several years ago by nonnuclear weapons states and civil society from across the globe. \nDismayed by the failure of the nuclear weapons states to honor their obligation under Article VI of the Non Proliferation Treaty which requires them to pursue good faith negotiations for the elimination of their nuclear arsenals, and moved by the growing danger of nuclear war, more than 120 nations gathered in Oslo in March of 2013 to review the latest scientific data about the catastrophic consequences that will result from the use of nuclear weapons. The conference shifted the focus of international discussion about nuclear war from abstract consideration of nuclear strategy to an evaluation of the medical data about what will actually happen if these weapons are used. It was boycotted by all of the major nuclear powers, the US, Russia, UK, China and France, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, or P5. \nFurther meetings in Nayarit, Mexico and Vienna followed in 2014 and culminated in a pledge by the Austrian government to close the gap in international law that does not yet specifically outlaw the possession of these weapons. More than 140 countries ultimately associated themselves with the pledge which was fiercely opposed by the United States and the other nuclear weapons states, and in the fall of 2015 the UN General Assembly voted to establish an Open Ended Working Group which met in Geneva earlier this year and recommended the negotiations approved Thursday. \nThe United States, which led the opposition had hoped to limit the Yes vote to less than one hundred, but failed badly. The final vote was 123 For, 38 Against and 16 Abstentions. The No votes came from the nuclear weapons states, and US allies in NATO, plus Japan, South Korea and Australia which have treaty ties to the US and consider themselves to be under the protection of the US nuclear umbrella. \nBut four nuclear weapons states broke ranks, with China, India and Pakistan abstaining, and North Korea voting in favor of the treaty negotiations. In addition, the Netherlands defied intense pressure from the rest of NATO and abstained, as did Finland, which is not a member of NATO but has close ties with the alliance. \nJapan which voted with the US against the treaty has indicated that it will, nonetheless, participate in the negotiations when they begin in March. \nThe US and the other nuclear weapons states will probably try to block final approval of the treaty conference by the General Assembly later this fall, but, following Thursdays vote, it appears overwhelmingly likely that negotiations will begin in March, and that they will involve a significant majority of UN member states, even if the nuclear states continue their boycott. \nThe successful completion of a new treaty will not of itself eliminate nuclear weapons. But it will put powerful new pressure on the nuclear weapons states who clearly do not want to uphold their obligations under the Non Proliferation Treaty even as they insist that the nonnuclear weapons states meet theirs. \nWe have come perilously close to nuclear war on multiple occasions during the last 70 years, and we have been incredibly lucky. US nuclear policy cannot continue to be the hope that we will remain lucky in the future. We need to join and lead the growing movement to abolish nuclear weapons and work to bring the other nuclear weapons states into a binding agreement that sets out the detailed time line for eliminating these weapons and the detailed verification and enforcement mechanisms to make sure they are eliminated. \nThis will not be an easy task, but we really have no choice. If we dont get rid of these weapons, someday, perhaps sooner rather than later, they will be used and they will destroy human civilization. The decision is ours. \nIra Helfand , MD, is past president of Physicians for Social Responsibility and is currently co-president of that groups global federation, the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, recipient of the 1985 Nobel Peace Prize.

[The Islamic State claimed that a soldier of the caliphate planted bombs in the middle of Crusaders gatherings, apparently taking credit for the carnage.  Breitbart Jerusalem obtained access to correspondence posted in a closed chat group that utilizes the encrypted Telegram messaging service. The chat group serves as an internal Twitter of sorts for IS jihadists and sympathizers, and it has been used in the past to issue IS communications. A militant named Abu Ayman Alalmani (the German) wrote, Thanks to Allah who allowed this achievement of the Mujahedeen. We are all believers in Allah that our brothers, the supporters and the Mujahedeen, are those who committed the attack among the infidels. We swear to Allah that the infidel countries in the West wont have the luxury of security. This is a Godly promise and this is the promise of the Mujahedeen, the future will prove to you that you are the countries of heresy. You will see this and not only hear it.  An account titled Muslim Justice wrote, Allah is great, Allah is great, we will shake the infidel and criminal regimes. We will destroy the rule of those who abandon Islam [a reference to Arab leaders]. Allah is great, this is a call that will rise high on the horizon and we will yet defeat the cross and the countries of infidels.  ISIS member Abu Abdullah Alsury (the Syrian) wrote, Thanks to Allah who caused the faithful to rejoice, we ask and request of Allah that this blessed act will be part of the battle of our brothers, the lone wolves roaming across all parts of the infidel nations, as they seek this type of blessed attack. This is part of the work and this is part of the revenge. Those infidel states will pay a heavy price.  Prior to the Islamic State claiming credit for the attack, another militant, Alqaqaa Alidlebi from Idlib, wrote, Were waiting for our brothers in the official media department to publish what should warm our hearts with an official declaration of responsibility, even if this isnt an organized act.  We pray to Allah that the attacker is a faithful Muslim. You arent aware of the huge happiness here in the ranks of the Mujahedeen and their families in the district of Elkheir (the area of Dir Azzur on the border between Syria and Iraq).

However, things didnt go so well for Hillary Clinton, who was humiliated when a camera caught what she immediately tried to hide to save her campaign  which backfired big time. \nWhile Donald Trumps 15,000-person army of Deplorables were holding down the fort in Stanford, Florida as they listened to this great leader explain how he plans to make America great again, Hillary was at a much smaller venue at Palm Beach State College. Although she was feeling pretty good about herself with having a higher turnout than shes used to, the approximate 1,000 to 2,000 attendees paled in comparison to what Trump was looking at in the same state. However, Hillarys anemic crowd was enough to be publicly mocked in front of. \nPerhaps Hillary didnt think anyone would notice, but Fox Business Network was watching  and commenting  live. With just fifteen minutes before the Democratic candidate was set to take the stage in one of her final and most important rallies, the small room should have been jam-packed with people. As the humored hosts noted on the news show, that was far from the case. \nHere it is nowhere near the size of the crowd we saw in Sanford, Florida yesterday for Mr. Trump, 15,000. Theres maybe a thousand to two thousand people here today, one host pointed out much to Hillarys embarrassment. The Clinton rallies tend to be much smaller and you can see theres empty space here and shes supposed to speak in 15 minutes. And I can tell you that as the camera pans across that if we were at a Trump rally this would absolutely be packed, the commentators added. \nNo matter how far ahead in the polls Hillary and her lapdog media says she is, the attendance at her events speaks volumes. Nobody cares or is enthusiastic enough about this woman to bother showing up, and those who do have to be coached on how to chant and act excited. \nOn the other hand, there are Trumps rallies, where so many people turn up to venues four times the size as Hillarys that these massive stadiums cant contain everyone who is eager to come, and some are turned away. If the turnout at the rallies is any indicator of whats expected at the polls, Hillary cant win, and if she does, Americans should definitely question how that could even happen","label":1,"_deepnote_index_column":27},{"id":28,"title":"Andrea Tantaros of Fox News Claims Retaliation for Sex Harassment Complaints - The New York Times","author":"Jim Dwyer","text":"Andrea Tantaros, a former Fox News host, charged in a lawsuit filed Monday that top executives at the network, including the man who replaced Roger Ailes, punished her for complaining about sexual harassment by Mr. Ailes. The suit by Ms. Tantaros, filed in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan, is the latest round in a contentious volley that began in late winter, when Fox claimed she had breached her employment contract by writing a book without receiving network approval. Fox News masquerades as a defender of traditional family values, but behind the scenes, it operates like a   Playboy   cult, steeped in intimidation, indecency and misogyny, Ms. Tantaross suit says. Fox News said it would not comment on pending litigation. Mr. Ailes, the networks founding chairman and guiding force for two decades, resigned last month after a former anchor, Gretchen Carlson, said in a suit that she was fired for refusing his sexual advances. Mr. Ailes has denied all allegations of harassment. In April, the chief lawyer for Fox charged that Ms. Tantaros had concocted sexual harassment claims to gain leverage in the contract dispute her lawyer, Judd Burstein, said the book dispute was a pretext that Fox was using to silence her. During arbitration, Mr. Burstein said, Fox News offered to pay her a sum in the seven figures if she renounced claims against Mr. Ailes and others at the network, including the host Bill OReilly. According to the lawsuit, Ms. Tantaros said she had been subjected to unwelcome advances from Mr. OReilly, whom she had regarded as a friend and adviser. Ailes did not act alone, the lawsuit states. He may have been the primary culprit, but his actions were condoned by his most senior lieutenants, who engaged in a concerted effort to silence Tantaros by threats, humiliation and retaliation.  Ms. Tantaros also claimed in the lawsuit that she was the subject of humiliating posts by pseudonymous accounts on Twitter known as sock puppets that she says were instigated by the Fox News publicity department. Ms. Tantaros joined Fox as a contributor in 2010, and a year later was named   of The Five, which aired at 5 p. m. She said in the suit that she was repeatedly told by Fox executives that she could not wear pants on the air because Roger wants to see your legs.  The lawsuit goes on to say that on Aug. 12, 2014, Mr. Ailes called her into his office and asked if she was planning to marry and have children. Ailes then started complaining about marriage in general, and also made   jokes about being married, the lawsuit states. It describes Mr. Ailes as speculating on the sexual habits and preferences of 10 Fox News personalities. He asked Ms. Tantaros to turn around so I can get a good look at you, the lawsuit charges, adding that Ms. Tantaros refused. Soon after, she was moved from The Five to a   show, Outnumbered, that aired at midday. Mr. Ailes called her back for similar sessions in December 2014 and February 2015, the lawsuit charges, and when she continued to rebuff him, she encountered hostility from the Fox News publicity department. In the February meeting, she said, Mr. Ailes talked about how she would look in a bikini, and accused her of ending a   relationship because she had been merely using the man. The episode brought her to tears, the lawsuit states. She said the sole interview arranged by the publicity department during that period was with a writer for a blog controlled by Fox, who asked about her breasts and if she was difficult to work with. In April 2015, the lawsuit states, Ms. Tantaros met with Bill Shine, then a senior news executive and close aide to Mr. Ailes. She said that she told him about the meetings with Mr. Ailes and asked if he had told the head of publicity for Fox News, Irena Briganti, to go after her. The lawsuit claims that Mr. Shine told Tantaros that Briganti is like a rabid dog on a chain that we cant control. Sometimes that dog gets off the chain.  Then, pointing to a picture of Mr. Ailes on a magazine cover, the lawsuit charges, Mr. Shine told her that this powerful man has faith in Irena Briganti and that Ms. Tantaros needs to let this one go.  Mr. Shine, through a spokeswoman, has said that Ms. Tantaros never approached him about Mr. Ailes harassing her. Mr. Shine was named   of Fox News after Mr. Ailes departed.","label":0,"_deepnote_index_column":28},{"id":29,"title":"How Hillary Clinton Became a Hawk - The New York Times","author":"Mark Landler","text":"Hillary Clinton sat in the hideaway study off her ceremonial office in the State Department, sipping tea and taking stock of her first year on the job. The study was more like a den     cozy and   lined with bookshelves that displayed mementos from Clintons three decades in the public eye: a statue of her heroine, Eleanor Roosevelt a baseball signed by the Chicago Cubs star Ernie Banks a carved wooden figure of a pregnant African woman. The intimate setting lent itself to a   interview than the usual locale, her imposing outer office, with its marble fireplace, heavy drapes, crystal chandelier and ornate wall sconces. On the morning of Feb. 26, 2010, however, Clinton was talking about something more sensitive than mere foreign affairs: her relationship with Barack Obama. To say she chose her words carefully doesnt do justice to the delicacy of the exercise. She was like a   technician, deciding which color wire to snip without blowing up her relationship with the White House. Weve developed, I think, a very good rapport, really positive    about everything you can imagine, Clinton said about the man she described during the 2008 campaign as nave, irresponsible and hopelessly unprepared to be president. And weve had some interesting and even unusual experiences along the way.  She leaned forward as she spoke, gesturing with her hands and laughing easily. In talking with reporters, Clinton displays more warmth than Obama does, though theres less of an expectation that she might say something revealing. Clinton singled out, as she often would, the United Nations   meeting in Copenhagen the previous December, where she and Obama worked together to save the meeting from collapse. She brought up the Middle East peace proc ess, a signature project of the presidents, which she had been tasked with reviving. But she was understandably wary of talking about areas in which she and Obama split     namely, on bedrock issues of war and peace, where Clintons more activist philosophy had already collided in unpredictable ways with her bosss instincts toward restraint. She had backed Gen. Stanley McChrystals recommendation to send 40, 000 more troops to Afghanistan, before endorsing a fallback proposal of 30, 000 (Obama went along with that, though he stipulated that the soldiers would begin to pull out again in July 2011, which she viewed as problematic). She supported the Pentagons plan to leave behind a residual force of 10, 000 to 20, 000 American troops in Iraq (Obama balked at this, largely because of his inability to win legal protections from the Iraqis, a failure that was to haunt him when the Islamic State overran much of the country). And she pressed for the United States to funnel arms to the rebels in Syrias civil war (an idea Obama initially rebuffed before later, halfheartedly, coming around to it). That fundamental tension between Clinton and the president would continue to be a defining feature of her   tenure as secretary of state. In the administrations first   meeting on Russia in February 2009, aides to Obama proposed that the United States make some symbolic concessions to Russia as a gesture of its good will in resetting the relationship. Clinton, the last to speak, brusquely rejected the idea, saying, Im not giving up anything for nothing.  Her hardheadedness made an impression on Robert Gates, the defense secretary and George W. Bush holdover who was wary of a changed Russia. He decided there and then that she was someone he could do business with. I thought, This is a tough lady, he told me. A few months after my interview in her office, another split emerged when Obama picked up a secure phone for a weekend conference call with Clinton, Gates and a handful of other advisers. It was July 2010, four months after the North Korean military torpedoed a South Korean Navy corvette, sinking it and killing 46 sailors. Now, after weeks of fierce debate between the Pentagon and the State Department, the United States was gearing up to respond to this brazen provocation. The tentative plan     developed by Clintons deputy at State, James Steinberg     was to dispatch the aircraft carrier George Washington into coastal waters to the east of North Korea as an unusual show of force. But Adm. Robert Willard, then the Pacific commander, wanted to send the carrier on a more aggressive course, into the Yellow Sea, between North Korea and China. The Chinese foreign ministry had warned the United States against the move, which for Willard was all the more reason to press forward. He pushed the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mike Mullen, who in turn pushed his boss, the defense secretary, to reroute the George Washington. Gates agreed, but he needed the commander in chief to sign off on a decision that could have political as well as military repercussions. Gates laid out the case for diverting the George Washington to the Yellow Sea: that the United States should not look as if it was yielding to China. Clinton strongly seconded it. Weve got to run it up the gut! she had said to her aides a few days earlier. (The Vince Lombardi imitation drew giggles from her staff, who, even 18 months into her tenure, still marveled at her pugnacity.) Obama, though, was not persuaded. The George Washington was already underway changing its course was not a decision to make on the fly. I dont call audibles with aircraft carriers, he said     unwittingly   Clinton on her football metaphor. It wasnt the last debate in which she would side with Gates. The two quickly discovered that they shared a Midwestern upbringing, a taste for a stiff drink after a long day of work and a   skepticism about the intentions of Americas foes. Bruce Riedel, a former intelligence analyst who conducted Obamas initial review on the Afghanistan war, says: I think one of the surprises for Gates and the military was, here they come in expecting a very    administration, and they discover that they have a secretary of state whos a little bit right of them on these issues     a little more eager than they are, to a certain extent. Particularly on Afghanistan, where I think Gates knew more had to be done, knew more troops needed to be sent in, but had a lot of doubts about whether it would work.  As Hillary Clinton makes another run for president, it can be tempting to view her   rhetoric about the world less as deeply felt core principle than as calculated political maneuver. But Clintons   instincts are bred in the bone     grounded in cold realism about human nature and what one aide calls a textbook view of American exceptionalism.  It set her apart from her    Barack Obama, who avoided military entanglements and tried to reconcile Americans to a world in which the United States was no longer the undisputed hegemon. And it will likely set her apart from the Republican candidate she meets in the general election. For all their bluster about bombing the Islamic State into oblivion, neither Donald J. Trump nor Senator Ted Cruz of Texas has demonstrated anywhere near the appetite for military engagement abroad that Clinton has. Hillary is very much a member of the traditional American   establishment, says Vali Nasr, a   strategist who advised her on Pakistan and Afghanistan at the State Department. She believes, like presidents going back to the Reagan or Kennedy years, in the importance of the military     in solving terrorism, in asserting American influence. The shift with Obama is that he went from reliance on the military to the intelligence agencies. Their position was, All you need to deal with terrorism is N. S. A. and C. I. A. drones and special ops. So the C. I. A. gave Obama an angle, if you will, to be simultaneously hawkish and shun using the military.  Unlike other recent presidents     Obama, George W. Bush or her husband, Bill Clinton     Hillary Clinton would assume the office with a long record on national security. There are many ways to examine that record, but one of the most revealing is to explore her   cultivation of the military     not just civilian leaders like Gates, but also its   commanders, the men with the medals. Her affinity for the armed forces is rooted in a lifelong belief that the calculated use of military power is vital to defending national interests, that American intervention does more good than harm and that the writ of the United States properly reaches, as Bush once put it, into any dark corner of the world.  Unexpectedly, in the bombastic,   presidential election of 2016, Hillary Clinton is the last true hawk left in the race. For those who know Clintons biography, her embrace of the military should come as no surprise. She grew up in the buoyant aftermath of World War II, the daughter of a Navy petty officer who trained young sailors before they shipped out to the Pacific. Her father, Hugh Rodham, was a staunch Republican and an anticommunist, and she channeled his views. She talks often about her girlhood dream of becoming an astronaut, citing the rejection letter she got from NASA as the first time she encountered gender discrimination. Her real motive for volunteering, she has written, may have been because her father fretted that America was lagging behind Russia.  Political conversion came later, after Vietnam and the 60s swept over Wellesley College, where she spoke out against the establishment at her graduation. But even in the tumultuous year of 1968, she was still making her transition from Republican to Democrat, managing to go to the conventions of both parties. As a Republican intern in Washington that summer, she questioned a Wisconsin congressman, Melvin Laird, about the wisdom of Lyndon B. Johnsons escalating involvement in Southeast Asia. It was after law school that she had her most curious encounter with the military. In 1975, the year she married Bill Clinton, she stopped in at a Marine recruiting office in Arkansas to inquire about joining the active forces or reserves. She was a lawyer, she explained maybe there was some way she could serve. The recruiter, she recalled two decades later, was a young man of about 21, in prime physical condition. Clinton was then 27, freshly transplanted from Washington, teaching law at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville and wearing   eyeglasses. Youre too old, you cant see and youre a woman, he told her. Maybe the dogs will take you, he added, in what she said was a pejorative reference to the Army. It was not a very encouraging conversation, Clinton said at a lunch for military women on Capitol Hill in 1994. I decided, Maybe Ill look for another way to serve my country.  Some reporters have cast doubt on the veracity of this story, which she repeated in the fall of 2015 over breakfast with voters in New Hampshire: certainly, theres no concrete evidence that it happened, and Bill gave a different account of it in 2008, substituting the Army for the Marines. Why would a professionally minded Yale Law graduate, on the cusp of marriage, suddenly want to put on a uniform? Its impossible to decipher her possible motives, but Ann Henry, an old friend who taught at the university after Clinton moved to Little Rock, offers a theory: During those days, she recalls, female faculty members, as an exercise, would test the boundaries of careers that appeared closed to women. I dont think its made up, she says. It was consistent with something she would have done.  Clintons next sustained exposure to the military did not come until she was first lady, almost two decades later. Living in the White House is, in many ways, like living in a military compound. A Marine stands guard in front of the West Wing when the president is in the Oval Office. The Mili tary Office operates the medical center and the telecommunications system. The Navy runs the cafeteria, the Marines transport the president by helicopter, the Air Force by plane. Camp David is a naval facility. The daily contact with men and women in uniform, Clintons friends say, deepened her feelings for them. In March 1996, the first lady visited American troops stationed in Bosnia. The trip became notorious years later when she claimed, during the 2008 campaign, to have dodged sniper fire after her   military plane landed at an American base in Tuzla. (Chris Hill, a diplomat who was onboard that day and later served as ambassador to Iraq under Clinton, didnt remember snipers at all, and indeed recalled children handing her bouquets of spring flowers.) But there was no faking the good vibes during her tour of the mess and rec halls. With her teenage daughter at her side, she bantered and joked with the young servicemen and women     an experience, she wrote, that left lasting impressions on Chelsea and me.  When Clinton was elected to the Senate, she had strong political reasons to care about the mili tary. The Pentagon was in the midst of a long, politically charged process of closing military bases New York State had already been a victim, when Plattsburgh Air Force Base was closed in 1995, a loss of 352 civilian jobs for that   North Country town. New Yorks delegation was determined to protect its remaining bases, especially Fort Drum, home of the Armys 10th Mountain Division, which sprawls over a hundred thousand acres in rural Jefferson County. In October 2001, a month after the   terrorist attacks, Clinton traveled to Fort Drum at the invitation of Gen. Buster Hagenbeck, who had just been named the divisions commander and would be deployed to Afghanistan a month later. Like many of the officers I spoke with, he had preconceptions of Clinton from her years as first lady the woman who showed up at his office around happy hour that afternoon did not fulfill them. She sat down, he recalls, took her shoes off, put her feet up on the coffee table and said, General, do you know where a gal can get a cold beer around here? u2009 It was the start of a dialogue that stretched over two wars. In the spring of 2002, Hagenbeck led Operation Anaconda, a   assault on Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters in the    Valley that was the largest combat engagement of the war to date. When the general came back to Washington to brief the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Clinton took him out to dinner on Capitol Hill for her own briefing. They also spoke about the Bush administrations preparations for war in Iraq, something which Hagenbeck was following anxiously. The general, it turned out, was more of a dove than the senator. He warned her about the risks of an invasion, which was then being   inside the Pentagon. It would be like kicking over a bees nest, he said. Hagenbeck excused Clintons vote in 2002 to authorize military action in Iraq. She made a considered call, he says. And she was chagrined, much after the fact.  For him, what mattered more than Clintons voting record was her unstinting public support of the military, whether in protecting Fort Drum or backing him during a difficult first year in Afghanistan. Clintons education in military affairs began in earnest in 2002, after the Democratic Partys crushing defeat in midterm elections moved her up several rungs in Senate seniority. The partys congressional leaders offered her a seat on either the Senate Foreign Relations Committee or the Senate Armed Services Committee. She chose Armed Services, spurning a long tradition of New York senators, like Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jacob Javits, who coveted the prestige of Foreign Relations. Armed Services deals with more earthbound issues, like benefits for veterans, and it had long been the preserve of Republican hawks like John McCain. But after   Clinton saw Armed Services as better preparation for her future. For a politician looking to hone   credentials     a woman who aspired to be commander in chief     it was the perfect training ground. She dug in like a grunt at boot camp. Andrew Shapiro, then Senator Clintons   adviser, called upon 10 experts     including Bill Perry, who was defense secretary under her husband, and Ashton Carter, who would eventually become President Obamas fourth defense secretary     to tutor her on everything from grand strategy to defense procurement. She met quietly with Andrew Marshall, an octogenarian strategist at the Pentagon who labored for decades in the blandly named Office of Net Assessment, earning the nickname Yoda for his Delphic insights. She went to every committee meeting, no matter how mundane. Aides recall her on   sitting alone in the chamber, patiently questioning a lieutenant colonel. She visited the troops in Afghanistan on Thanksgiving Day in 2003 and spoke at every significant military installation in New York State. By then     30 years after she recalled being rejected by a Marine recruiter in Arkansas     Hillary Clinton had become a military wonk. Jack Keane is one of the intellectual architects of the Iraq surge he is also perhaps the greatest single influence on the way Hillary Clinton thinks about military issues. A bear of a man with a jowly, careworn face and   hair, Keane exudes the supreme   you would expect of a retired   general. He speaks with a trace of a New York accent that gives his pronouncements a    urgency. He is also a   member of the   complex, sitting on the board of General Dynamics and serving as a strategic adviser to Academi, the   contractor once known as Blackwater. And he is the chairman of an aptly named think tank, the Institute for the Study of War. Though he is one of a parade of   generals, Keane is the resident hawk on Fox News, where he appears regularly to call for the United States to use greater military force in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. He doesnt shrink from putting boots on the ground and has little use for civilian leaders, like Obama, who do. Keane first got to know Clinton in the fall of 2001, when she was a freshman senator and he was the Armys second in command, with a distinguished combat and command record in Vietnam, Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia and Kosovo. He had expected her to be intelligent,   and politically astute, but he was not prepared for the respect she showed for the Army as an institution, or her sympathy for the sacrifices made by soldiers and their families. Keane was confident he could smell a phony politician a mile away, and he didnt get that whiff from her. I read people thats one of my strengths, he told me. Its not that I cant be fooled, but Im not fooled often.  Clinton took an instant liking to Keane, too. She loves that Irish gruff thing, says one of her Senate aides, Kris Balderston, who was in the room that day. When Keane got up after 45 minutes to leave for a meeting back at the Pentagon with a Polish general, she protested that she wasnt finished yet and asked for another appointment. I said, O. K. but it took me three months to get this one,u2009 Keane told her dryly. Clinton exploded into a raucous laugh. Ill take care of that problem, she promised. She was true to her word: The two would meet many times over the next decade, discussing the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Iranian nu clear threat and other flash points in the Middle East. Sometimes he dropped by her Senate office other times they met for dinner or drinks. He escorted her on her first visit to Fort Drum and set up her first trip to Iraq. They generally agreed to forgo talk of politics, but at a meeting in Clintons Senate office in January 2007, Keane tried to sell her on the logic of a troop surge in Iraq. The previous month, he had met with President Bush in the Oval Office to recommend that the United States deploy five to eight Army and Marine brigades to wage an urban counterinsurgency campaign only that, he argued, would stabilize a country being ripped apart by sectarian strife. His presentation angered some of Keanes fellow generals, who feared that such a strategy would deepen Iraqs dependency and prolong Americas involvement. But it had a big impact on the commander in chief, who soon ordered more than 20, 000 additional troops to Iraq. Clinton was another story. Im convinced its not going to work, Jack, she told him. She predicted that the American soldiers patrolling in Iraqi cities and towns would be blown up by Sunni militias or Al Qaeda fighters. She thought we would fail, Keane recalls, and it was going to cause increased casualties.  Politics, of course, was also on her mind. Barack Obama was laying the groundwork for his candidacy in   with a campaign that would emphasize his opposition to the Iraq War and her vote in favor of it     a vote that still shadows her in this years Democratic primaries. Obama was setting off on a   drive that would net $25 million in three months, sending tremors through Clintons political camp and establishing him as a formidable rival. Although she disagreed with Keane about Iraq, Clinton asked him to become a formal adviser. As much as I respect you, he replied, I cant do that.  Keanes wife had health problems that had moved up his retirement from the Army, and he did not, as a policy, endorse candidates. Sometime during 2008     he doesnt remember exactly when     Clinton told him she had erred in doubting the wisdom of the surge. She said, You were right, this really did work,u2009 Keane recalls. On issues of national security, he says, I thought she was always intellectually honest with me.  He and Clinton continued to talk, even after Obama was elected and she became secretary of state. More often than not, they found themselves in sync. Keane, like Clinton, favored more robust intervention in Syria than Obama did. In April 2015, the week before she announced her candidacy, Clinton asked him for a briefing on military options for dealing with the fighters of the Islamic State. Bringing along three young female analysts from the Institute for the Study of War, Keane gave her a     presentation. Among other steps, he advocated imposing a   zone over parts of Syria that would neutralize the air power of the Syrian president, Bashar   with a goal of forcing him into a political settlement with opposition groups. Six months later, Clinton publicly adopted this position, further distancing herself from Obama. Im convinced this president, no matter what the circumstances, will never put any boots on the ground to do anything, even when its compelling, Keane told me. He was sitting in the library at his home in McLean, Va. which is lined with books on military history and strategy. His critique of Obama was hardly new or original, but much of it mirrors the thinking of Clinton and her policy advisers. One of the problems the president has, which weakens his diplomatic efforts, is that leaders dont believe he would use military power. Thats an issue that would separate the president from Hillary Clinton rather dramatically. She would look at military force as another realistic option, but only where there is no other option.  Befriending Keane wasnt just about cultivating a single adviser. It gave Clinton instant entree to his informal network of   and retired generals. The most interesting by far was David Petraeus, a cerebral commander who shared Clintons   ambition and whose life stories would mix heady success with humbling setbacks. Both would be accused of mishandling classified information     Clinton because of her use of a private server and email address to conduct sensitive government business, a decision that erupted into a political scandal Petraeus because he had given a diary containing classified information to his biographer and mistress (he was eventually charged with a misdemeanor for mishandling classified information). On Clintons first trip to Iraq in November 2003, Petraeus, then a   general commanding the 101st Airborne Division, flew from his field headquarters in Mosul to the relative safety of Kirkuk to brief her congressional delegation. She was full of questions, he recalls. It was the kind of gesture that means a lot to a battlefield commander.  On subsequent trips, as he rose in rank, Petraeus walked her through his plans to train and equip Iraqi Army troops, a forerunner of the counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan. It worked to their mutual benefit: Petraeus was building ties to a prominent Democratic voice in the Senate Clinton was burnishing her image as a friend of the troops. She did it the   way, he says. She did it by pursuing relationships.  When Petraeus was sent back to Iraq as the top commander in early 2007, he gave every member of the Senate Armed Services Committee a copy of the U. S.   Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual, which he edited during a tour at Fort Leavenworth. Clinton read hers from cover to cover. Although Clintons reservations about the surge were valid     the stability that the additional troops brought to Iraq didnt last     her opposition to it, like her vote for the war, came back to haunt her. This time, it was her ally Bob Gates who summoned the ghost. In his memoirs, Gates wrote that she confessed to him and the president that her position had been politically motivated, because she was then facing Obama in the Iowa caucuses. (Obama, he wrote, vaguely conceded that he, too, had opposed it for political reasons.) Clinton pushed back, telling Diane Sawyer of ABC News that Gates perhaps either missed the context or the meaning, because I did oppose the surge.  Her opposition, she told Sawyer, was driven by the fact that at that time, people were not going to accept any escalation of the war. This is not politics in electoral, political terms, Clinton said. This is politics in the sense of the American public has to support commitments like this.  The next time she found herself in a debate over sending troops into harms way, she voiced no such reservations. We need maps, Hillary Clinton told her aides. It was early October 2009, and she had just returned from a meeting in the Situation Room. Obamas war cabinet was debating how many additional troops to send to Afghanistan, where the United States, preoccupied by Iraq, had allowed the Taliban to regroup. The Pentagon, she reported, had used impressive,   maps to show its plans to deploy troops around the country. The attention to detail made Gates and his commanders look crisp and well prepared the State Department, which was pushing a civilian surge to accompany the troops, looked wan by comparison. At the next meeting, on Oct. 14, the team from State unfurled its own maps to show the deployment of an army of aid workers, diplomats, legal experts and crop specialists who were supposed to follow the soldiers into Afghanistan. Clintons fixation with maps was typical of her   in the first great    debate of the Obama presidency. She wanted to be taken seriously, even if her department was less central than the Pentagon. One way to do that was by promoting the civilian surge, the pet project of her friend and special envoy to the region, Richard Holbrooke. She was determined that her briefing books would be just as thick and just as meticulous as those of the Pentagon, a senior adviser recalls. She also didnt hesitate to get into the Pentagons business, asking detailed questions about the training of Afghan troops and wading into the weeds of military planning. She resolved not to miss out on anything     a determination that may have been rooted in a deeper insecurity about her role in what was to become the most White   administration of the modern era. On the morning of June 8, 2009, she emailed two aides to say: I heard on the radio that there is a Cabinet mtg this am. Is there? Can I go? If not, who are we sending? On Feb. 10, 2010, she dialed the White House from her home, but couldnt get past the switchboard operator, who didnt believe she was really Hillary Clinton. Asked to provide her office number to prove her identity, she said she didnt know it. Finally, Clinton hung up in frustration and placed the call again through the State Department Operations Center     like a proper and properly dependent secretary of state, as she later wrote to one aide in a   tone. No independent dialing allowed.  The Afghan troop debate, a   drama of dueling egos, leaked documents and endless deliberations, is typically framed as a test of wills between the Pentagons wily military commanders and an inexperienced young president, with Joe Biden playing the role of devils advocate for Obama. While that portrait is accurate, it neglects the role of Clinton. By siding with Gates and the generals, she gave political ballast to their proposals and provided a bullish counterpoint to Bidens skepticism. Her role should not be overstated: She did not turn the debate, nor did she bring to it any distinctive point of view. But her unstinting support of General McChrystals maximalist recommendation made it harder for Obama to choose a lesser option. (McChrystal was later fired by Obama after his aides made derogatory remarks about almost every member of his war cabinet to Rolling Stone magazine she was the exception. Hillary had Stans back, one of his aides told the reporter, Michael Hastings.) Hillary was adamant in her support for what Stan asked for, Gates says. She made clear that she was ready to support his request for the full 40, 000 troops. She then made clear that she was only willing to go with the 30, 000 number because I proposed it. She was, in a way, tougher on the numbers in the surge than I was.  Gates believed that if he could align Clinton the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mike Mullen the commander of Central Command, David Petraeus and himself behind a common position, it would be hard for Obama to say no. How could you ignore these Four Horsemen of national security? says Geoff Morrell, who served as the Pentagon press secretary at the time. Just as Clinton benefited from her alliance with the military commanders, she gave them political cover. Heres the dirty little secret, says Tom Nides, her former deputy secretary of state for management and resources. They all knew they wanted her on their side. They knew that if they walked into the Situation Room and they had her, it made a huge difference in the dynamics. When she opened her mouth, she could change the momentum in the room.  David Axelrod recalls one meeting where Clinton kicked the thing off and pretty much articulated their opinion Im sure thats one that they remember. Theres no doubt that she wanted to give them every troop that McChrystal was asking for.  Still, Clinton didnt prevail on every argument. After agreeing to send the troops, Obama added a condition of his own: that the soldiers be deployed as quickly as possible and pulled out again, starting in the summer of 2011     a deadline that proved more fateful in the long run than a difference of 10, 000 troops. Clinton opposed setting a public deadline for withdrawal, arguing that it would tip Americas hand to the Taliban and encourage them to wait out the United States     which, in fact, was exactly what happened. In the final days of the debate, Clinton also found herself at odds with her own ambassador in Kabul, Karl Eikenberry. He, too, held different views than she did on the wisdom of a surge, which he put into writing. On Nov. 6, 2009, in a long cable addressed to Clinton     and later leaked to The New York Times     he made a trenchant, convincing case for why the McChrystal proposal, which she endorsed two weeks earlier in a meeting with Obama, would saddle the United States with vastly increased costs and an indefinite,   military role in Afghanistan.  Much of Eikenberrys analysis proved prescient, particularly his warnings about the threadbare American partnership with the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai. It carried an extra sting because he was a retired   Army general who was the commander in Afghanistan from 2005 to 2007. Clinton, who had not asked for the cable, was furious, fearing it could upset a debate in which she and the Pentagon were about to prevail. What the cable made clear was the degree to which the Afghanistan debate was dominated by military considerations. While Clinton did raise the need to deal with Afghanistans neighbor, Pakistan, her reflexive support of Gates, Petraeus and McChrystal meant she was not a powerful voice for diplomatic alternatives. She contributed to the overmilitarizing of the analysis of the problem, says Sarah Chayes, who was an adviser to McChrystal and later to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mike Mullen. In October 2015, the persistent violence in Afghanistan and the legacy of Karzais misrule forced Obama to reverse his plan to withdraw the last American soldiers by the end of his presi dency. A few thousand troops will stay there indefinitely. And for all of Clintons talk about a civilian surge, it never really materialized. For Clinton, the Afghanistan episode laid bare a vexed relationship between her and Eikenberry, one of the few generals with whom she didnt hit it off. A   with graduate degrees from Harvard and Stanford, Eikenberry was brilliant but had a reputation among his colleagues for being imperious. Clinton had a similarly chilly relationship with Douglas Lute, another Army lieutenant general with a graduate degree from Harvard, who also fought with Holbrooke. She likes the       McChrystal, Petraeus, Keane, one of her aides observes. Real military guys, not these retired   who go into civilian jobs.  Theres no doubt that Hillary Clintons more muscular brand of American foreign policy is better matched to 2016 than it was to 2008, said Jake Sullivan, her top policy adviser at the State Department, who plays the same role in her campaign. It was De cem ber 2015, 53 days before the Iowa caucuses, and Sullivan was sitting down with me in Clintons sprawling Brooklyn headquarters to explain how she was shaping her message for a campaign suddenly dominated by concerns about national security. Clintons strategy, he said, was twofold: Explain to voters that she had a clear plan for confronting the threat posed by Islamic terrorism, and expose her Republican opponents as utterly lacking in experience or credibility on national security. There were good reasons for Clinton to let her inner hawk fly. After the attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif. Americans concern about a major attack on the nation spiked. A   poll taken after Paris showed that a majority, 53 percent, favored sending ground troops to Iraq or Syria, a remarkable shift from the   sentiment that prevailed during most of Obamas presidency. The Republican candidates were reaching for apocalyptic metaphors to demonstrate their resolve. Ted Cruz threatened to   the Islamic State to test whether desert sand can glow Donald Trump called for the United States to ban all Muslims from entering the country until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses.  Yet such spikes in the public appetite for mili tary action tend to be transitory. Three weeks later, the same poll showed an even split, at 49 percent, on whether to deploy troops. Neither Trump nor Cruz favors major new deployments of American soldiers to Iraq and Syria (nor, for that matter, does Clinton). If anything, both are more skeptical than Clinton about intervention and more circumspect than she about maintaining the nations   War II military commitments. Trump loudly proclaims his opposition to the Iraq War. He wants the United States to spend less to underwrite NATO and has talked about withdrawing the American security umbrella from Asia, even if that means Japan and South Korea would acquire nuclear weapons to defend themselves. Cruz, unlike Clinton, opposed aiding the Syrian rebels in 2014. He once supported Pentagon budget constraints advocated by his isolationist colleague, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky. Thus might the gen eral election present voters with an unfamiliar choice: a Democratic hawk versus a Republican reluctant warrior. To thwart the progressive insurgency of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Clinton carefully calibrated her message during the Democratic primaries to align herself closely with Barack Obama and his racially diverse coalition. But as she pivots to the general election, that balancing act with Obama will become trickier. Theres going to be a huge amount of interest in the press to  Sullivan says. It just so easily can become a sport that distracts from her ability to make an affirmative case.  In showing her stripes as a prospective commander in chief, Clinton will no doubt draw heavily upon her State Department experience     filtering the lessons she learned in Libya, Syria and Iraq into the sinewy worldview she has held since childhood. Last fall, in a series of policy speeches, Clinton began limning distinctions with the president on national security. She said the United States should consider sending more   troops to Iraq than Obama had committed, to help the Iraqis and Kurds fight the Islamic State. She came out in favor of a partial   zone over Syria. And she described the threat posed by ISIS to Americans in starker terms than he did. As is often the case with Clinton and Obama, the differences were less about direction than degree. She wasnt calling for ground troops in the Middle East, any more than he was. Clinton insisted her plan was not a break with his, merely an intensification and acceleration of it. Its an open question how well Clintons hawkish instincts match the countrys mood. Americans are weary of war and remain suspicious of foreign entanglements. And yet, after the retrenchment of the Obama years, there is polling evidence that they are equally dissatisfied with a portrait of their country as a spent force, managing its decline amid a world of rising powers like China, resurgent empires like Vladimir Putins Russia and lethal new forces like the Islamic State. If Obamas minimalist approach was a necessary reaction to the maximalist style of his predecessor, then perhaps what Americans yearn for is something in between     the kind of   pragmatism that Clinton has spent a lifetime honing. The president has made some tough decisions, says Leon Panetta, who served as Obamas defense secretary after Bob Gates, and as director of the C. I. A. before David Petraeus. But its been a mixed record, and the concern is, the president defining what Americas role in the world is in the 21st century hasnt happened. Hopefully, hell do it, he added, acknowledging the time Obama has left. Certainly, she would.

Todd said BuzzFeeds decision to publish the dossier was an instance where they would not have made the same decision in the   era.  Smith stated that it was more the   era.  And that there was a time where we could act as gatekeepers. Where we could say, you know what, crazy people are claiming that Barack Obamas birth certificate is forged, but were not going to write about that, thats crazy.  He continued that this era doesnt exist, and that while they had reporters trying to confirm or deny specific details, the dossier was in play, and having consequences for the way our elected leaders are acting. The     you do have to ask the question of, why should I suppress that? There are then good reasons, right? Once though, it emerges, as it did last night in the public conversation that there is this secret document floating around, full of dark allegations that we will not repeat to you. That I feel like in this era, you really have to share [with] your readers what that is in an appropriate context. And our original report, I mean, if you read what we wrote, it stressed that there were real solid reasons to distrust this. It noted two specific errors.  Todd then asked if BuzzFeed had a responsibility to not spread false information. Smith responded that, like with the Obama birth certificate issue, its a difficult balance that everybody in our business navigates every day.  Todd then asked if BuzzFeed would publish a false birth certificate. Smith answered, We certainly quoted the   of the United States making false claims about it, and years ago we debated whether we should quote regular citizens in Iowa saying, I dont believe his birth certificate. And I remember us thinking at first, we probably shouldnt. That we we shouldnt pass that on and then saying, you know what, this has become a force that is impacting the conversation.  Todd countered, I know this was not your intent. Ive known you a long time, but you just published fake news.  Smith countered that people throw the term fake news around to diminish things they dont like, and that this was a real story about a real document that was really being passed around between the very top officials of this country. And then the question you say is, okay, its okay for you     to Chuck Todd see this document. Its okay for me to see it. Okay for Senator John McCain ( ). Okay for the CIA. Whats     why is it not okay for your audience? Todd then countered that BuzzFeed could have published a redacted version of the document. Smith answered that there was fair disagreement, but didnt think you could defend acknowledging the dossiers existence but then not say what was in it and that this was saying it was okay to summarize false claims. Smith further stated that if there wasnt a public conversation about the dossier, they would have just continued to report the story out.

The so-called Arab spring has brought many changes in its wake. However, war being one of the most important outcomes of this spring, certain changes in the erstwhile foreign policy orientation of many countries, big and small alike, was expected. To this particular outcome owes the growth of China-Israel relations that continue to develop stronger and deeper every year. Facts speak for themselves: Chinas total capital investment in Israeli high-tech deals involving Chinese businesses is expected to reach around $500 million by the end of 2016, compared to $467 million in 2014 and $118 million in 2012. And as Times of Israel reported recently, Chinese acquisitions in Israel have dramatically increased in the last few years. In March 2015, Chinas Bright Food acquired Tnuva , one of Israels largest dairy companies for approximately $2.1 billion. Similarly, in July 2016, a Chinese consortium that included private equity firm Yunfeng Capital  founded by Alibaba Group founder Jack Ma  acquired Israeli social games company Playtika from Caesars Interactive Entertainment online games unit for $4.4 billion in cash. In August 2016, ChemChina completed its takeover of Adama  considered one of the worlds leading crop protection companies  for approximately $1.4 billion. The high level of growth isand it is not a coincidencerunning parallel to the intensification and geographical spread of the conflict in the Mid-East region, particularly in and around the Suez canal region. While Syria and Iraq are direct victims of terrorism, many important countries such as Egypt (read: Egypts Sisi is building ties with Syria because of the fears of being the next target of jihadist militias) are only inches away from breaking down into shatters, pushing China to find an alternative route and construct an alternative geography of trade to steer its own business in the region. Israel, as such, happens to be the best country in the region. Not only is it politically and militarily stable, but its geographical location also makes it an apt candidate to qualify for partnership in Chinas Silk Road on its southern corridor, which is Chinas route to Europe. Before the emergence of jihadi groups in the Middle East, China depended on the Suez Canal to reach its largest export destination: Europe. With its trade volume standing roughly at 521 billion in 2015, and the volume of their bi-lateral trade crossing well over 1 billion a day , Europe undoubtedly remains one of the most important markets for the Chinese business, and with it remains the Mid-East the only geographical entity to facilitate this trade. However, the presence of ISIS, Al Qaeda and other Islamic extremist groups in the Sinai are threatening Chinas maritime trade. With over 95% of global trade being seaborne and China now as the worlds largest trading state, this is a serious challenge for Beijings continued economic development. The crisis in the Middle East is, therefore, directly threatening Chinas economic interest. And, while China has already stepped in the crisis (read: Chinas Rear Adm Guan Youfei recently visited Syria to boost co-operation with the Syrian army), this is not the only way it is following to protect its vital interests. This is where Israel becomes important for China. The growing economic alliance between Israel and China is moving forward with a $2 billion, 300 kilometre freight rail link connecting Eilat, on the Red Sea, with Ashdod Port, on the Mediterranean. The project, nicknamed the Red-Med, was greenlit by Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus cabinet, and construction, which is expected to take five years, will begin within the year. About the link, Netanyahu said, Its the first time wed be able to assist the countries in Europe and Asia to make sure they always have an open connection between Europe and Asia and between Asia and Europe. While Israel is clearly poised to play a pivotal role in providing an unhindered and a secure trade route for European and Asia countries, Chinas primary motivation is not to merely to build a network of allies in the Middle East. For China, the primary concern remains, apart from its trade with the Mid-Eastern countries, access to Europe and the African continent via the Middle East. However, both of these concerns cannot be effectively satisfied when the entire region remains under crisis. China, due to its fairly balanced approach to the crisis and the fact that it is perhaps the only global player that continues to enjoy equally good relations with such arch rivals as, for instance, Israel and Iran and Saudi Arabia and Iran, is an important country for the regional countries to look up to as a conflict mediator. This assumption about China playing this role owes its existence to the geography of trade China is eyeing to build through the Mid-East. As an alternative to shipping through the crowded Suez Canal, China sees value in sending goods into the Persian Gulf, and shipping them overland to the Mediterranean via several lines that could cross through Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar or even southern Iraq before finally continuing through Jordan and Israel. Will China eventually built this geography or not is a moot question. However, it is quite obvious that regional countries are open to it and know the potential benefits it can yield. Speaking at to the inaugural SIGNAL conference on Israels China policy at the IDC in Herzliya in the last week of September, Capt. Yigal Maor, director general of the Israels Transportation Ministrys Administration of Shipping and Ports, said that If China invests in building those paths, which he dubbed IGEC  the Israel Gulf Economic Corridor  it could push Gulf countries into more formal ties with Israel. Maybe with the help of China there will be peace in that area, he said. Whereas such prospects signal Israels own elevation from the position of a US protected state to an important power, integrating the region, as also continents, the potential entry of the dragon in the region, connecting various countries into a whole, is likely to yield important results for the whole region. While we may have to wait a little to see what impact it leaves exactly, it is quite obvious that China is poised to become an important player in the Mideast security scene, and is already asserting its role economically, diplomatically and, to some extent, militarily.

In the days since Britain voted to leave the bloc, the movements leaders have often appeared as if they had not expected to win and were not prepared to cope with the consequences. Faced with the scope of the decision, they have been busy walking back promises they made during the campaign and scaling back expectations. They have failed to show a united front or to answer basic questions. Their faltering performance has added to the sense of political chaos in Britain and, arguably, to the turmoil in the financial markets. And it has undercut their credibility and authority as Mr. Johnson prepares his bid to become prime minister and lead Britain into a new relationship with the Continent. The stakes are high for Mr. Johnson in particular, as he tries to build an impression as a capable leader amid the chaos that followed the vote in favor of a British exit, or Brexit.  But the mixed signals coming from him and other proponents of leaving the European Union have left their intentions unclear on such basic issues as when and how they will seek to negotiate a withdrawal, and what kind of new arrangement they want. To the degree that they have signaled a direction, it has often been substantially different from what they promised during the campaign. On issues from immigration to spending on the National Health Service, the Leave coalition has retreated from its more populist and apparently exaggerated claims. Many of those assertions had been promoted by the   U. K. Independence Party, or UKIP, led by Nigel Farage, and benefited the broader Leave campaign, whose most prominent figures included two senior Conservatives, Mr. Johnson and Michael Gove, the justice minister. In changing their tune, the leaders of the   Union campaign risk undermining whatever trust they had earned from the millions who voted to leave the bloc in the expectation that immigration would be cut sharply and that money now going to the European Union     which the Leave campaign said was 350 million pounds, or $465 million, a week     would be available to help finance the National Health Service. For example, one Leave advocate, Iain Duncan Smith, a former Conservative Party leader and cabinet secretary, walked away from the campaign pledge to reallocate the 350 million a week to the health service. Instead, he said, the lions share of anything left from that amount after replacing subsidies from the bloc to British farmers could be available for health services. On immigration, too, there was immediate backtracking from Mr. Johnson and Daniel Hannan, a member of the European Parliament from the Conservative Party, who told the BBC, Frankly, if people watching think that they have voted and there is now going to be zero immigration from the E. U. they are going to be disappointed.  Analysts say the change in tone may be necessary to begin reeling in unrealistic expectations about the changes the referendum could produce, but it also holds considerable political peril for Mr. Johnson and other Conservative Party leaders of the Leave campaign, especially with populist sentiment spreading and   groups like the U. K. Independence Party eager to build support. There is a clear tension between what the voter wanted and what senior euroskeptic leaders want to produce, said Matthew Goodwin, a professor of politics and international relations at the University of Kent. If they dont deliver radical reforms on immigration, it would be the equivalent of pouring gasoline on the populist UKIP fire that has been burning since 2010.  In his regular column in The Daily Telegraph on Monday, Mr. Johnson tried to strike a prime ministerial tone of unity in the wake of the divisive referendum, but he emphasized continuity over change and tried to argue that immigration, clearly the primary motivation for many voters in taking a position against Europe, was somehow not a major issue. It is said that those who voted Leave were mainly driven by anxieties about immigration, Mr. Johnson wrote. I do not believe that is so.  Suggesting that he wants to keep some kind of open flow of people across the border with Europe, Mr. Johnson wrote, British people will still be able to go and work in the E. U. to live to travel to study to buy homes and to settle down.  Not only that, he asserted, There will continue to be free trade, and access to the single market.  What he described was a relationship with the European Union like that of Norway, which would allow freedom of movement and labor and would pay money to Brussels in return for access to the single market, but without having a voice in  . But Mr. Johnson rejected the Norway model during the campaign, and even if negotiations proved to lead to a slightly enhanced Norway, with some symbolic measures to restrict immigration of European Union citizens to Britain, the result would be a betrayal of those who voted Leave. And right now, Norway pays Brussels roughly per capita what Britain currently does as a full member. The difficulty for Boris and Gove is that Brexit feels like a column gone wrong, an academic exercise suddenly turned into reality, Paul Waugh wrote in his blog for The Huffington Post, alluding to the shared backgrounds in journalism of Mr. Johnson and Mr. Gove. And reality, particularly where the E. U. is concerned, is a messy, complex thing.  Mr. Johnson is clearly looking to unite the divided Conservative Party behind his own, flamboyant self and to burnish his   economic credentials. But playing down immigration, Mr. Goodwin said, could create more political trouble. I worry for senior euroskeptic leaders, because there is a misunderstanding of the vote, and that will feed voter dissatisfaction, he said, driving many of the voters who chose a British exit to turn away from both mainstream parties and move to the populist right. The referendum was unusual, because it pitted a government on one side, Remain, against a loose coalition on the other, made up of Conservatives, some Labour legislators and U. K. Independence Party supporters. The Leave side never had to hammer out an agreement on how to proceed if it won, said Tony Travers, a professor of government at the London School of Economics. There was no coherence, because it wasnt a political party fighting for government, but an odd coalition fighting against something, but with no consistent view of what it was fighting for, he said. Even on the economy, the Leave side was made of   economists who believe in no tariffs at all, those who believe in trade deals and protectionists who want to shield the declining working class against globalization, Professor Travers said. And now the government will have to be reformed as if it were representing the Leave side and yet represent both, a   government that must reflect the schism in itself, he said. In the aftermath of the Leave campaigns victory, the political editor for Sky News, Faisal Islam, asked a Conservative member of Parliament who supported leaving the bloc to see his camps plan. The legislator replied, according to Mr. Islam: There is no plan. The Leave campaign dont have a   plan.  Then the legislator added, Number 10 should have had a plan, referring to the prime ministers office.","label":0,"_deepnote_index_column":32},{"id":33,"title":"Texas Oil Fields Rebound From Price Lull, but Jobs Are Left Behind - The New York Times","author":"Clifford Krauss","text":"MIDLAND, Tex.     In the land where oil jobs were once a guaranteed road to security for   workers, Eustasio Velazquezs career has been upended by technology. For 10 years, he laid cables for service companies doing seismic testing in the search for the next big gusher. Then, powerful computer hardware and software replaced cables with wireless data collection, and he lost his job. He found new work connecting pipes on rigs, but lost that job, too, when plunging oil prices in 2015 forced the driller he worked for to replace rig hands with cheaper, more reliable automated tools. I dont see a future, Mr. Velazquez, 44, said on a recent afternoon as he stooped over his shopping cart at a local grocery store. Pretty soon every rig will have one worker and a robot.  Oil and gas workers have traditionally had some of the     jobs     just the type that President Trump has vowed to preserve and bring back. But the West Texas oil fields, where activity is gearing back up as prices rebound, illustrate how difficult it will be to meet that goal. As in other industries, automation is creating a new demand for   workers     sometimes hundreds of miles away in a control center     but their numbers dont offset the ranks of field hands no longer required to sling chains and lift iron. So while there is a general sense of relief in the oil patch that a recovery is gaining momentum, discussions at company meetings and family kitchen tables are rife with aching worries, especially among those who are   with no more than a high school education. Roughly 163, 000 oil jobs were lost nationally from the 2014 peak, or about 30 percent of the total, while oil prices plummeted, at one point by as much as 70 percent. The job losses just in Texas, the most productive   state, totaled 98, 000. Several thousand workers have come back to work in recent months as the price of oil has begun to rise again, but energy experts say that between a third and a half of the workers who lost their jobs are not returning. Many have migrated to construction or even jobs in renewable energy, like wind power. People have left the industry, and they are not coming back, said Michael Dynan, vice president for portfolio and strategic development at Schramm, a Pennsylvania manufacturer of drilling rigs. If its a repetitive task, it can be automated, and I dont need someone to do that. I can get a computer to do that.  Indeed, computers now direct drill bits that were once directed manually. The wireless technology taking hold across the oil patch allows a handful of geoscientists and engineers to monitor the drilling and completion of multiple wells at a time     onshore or miles out to sea     and supervise immediate fixes when something goes wrong, all without leaving their desks. It is a world where rigs walk on their own legs and sensors on wells alert headquarters to a leak or loss of pressure, reducing the need for a technician to check. And despite all the lost workers, United States oil production is galloping upward, to nine million barrels a day from 8. 6 million in September. Nationwide, with a bit more than   as many rigs operating as in 2014, production is not even down 10 percent from record levels. Some of the best wells here in the Permian Basin that three years ago required an oil price of over $60 a barrel for an operator to break even now need about $35, well below the current price of about $53. Much of the technology has been developed by the aviation and automotive industries, along with deepwater oil exploration, over more than a decade. But companies drilling on land were slow to adapt until oil prices crashed and companies needed to get efficient quickly or go out of business. All the big companies, and many smaller ones, have organized teams of technicians that collect well and tank data to develop complex algorithms enabling them to duplicate the design for the most productive wells over and over, and to repair valves and other parts before they break down. The result is improved production and safety, but also a far smaller work force, and one that is increasingly morphing from muscle to brain power. Pioneer Natural Resources, one of the most productive West Texas producers, has slashed the number of days to drill and complete wells so drastically that it has been able to cut costs by 25 percent in wells completed since early 2015. The typical rig that drilled eight to 12 wells a year just a few years ago now drills up to 16. Last year, the company added nearly 240 wells to its Permian Basin inventory without adding new employees. The faster operations, Pioneer executives say, are due in large part to more effective well planning and drill steering. Both have been made possible by the   computer connections between the rig and top geoscientists back at corporate headquarters and intense analysis of the data gathered at every well. The laborious task of checking tank levels by climbing a flight of steps and popping open a series of latches, for instance, has been replaced by pressing a few icons on a computer touch screen. A fully automated water pump station installed last summer is intended to save hundreds of truck trips every day hauling water for hydraulically fracturing wells, yielding diesel and labor cost savings. We want to transform our work force to the point where we need to hire fewer people, said Joey Hall, Pioneers executive vice president for Permian operations. Improved computing streamlines operations, he noted, and lets technicians optimally space their wells and more accurately perforate the sweet spots of shale veins to squeeze every drop of oil out of the ground. Were heading toward artificial intelligence and machine learning, analyzing thousands of algorithms, Mr. Hall added, sounding more like a Silicon Valley futurologist than a wildcatter. Through repetitive operations, you learn the patterns, and through patterns you learn to make automated decisions.  With the loss of manual jobs has come a transformation in the job force, with demand growing for more data analysts, math scientists, communications specialists and robotic design engineers. In the last two years, ABB, the Swiss technology company, has opened two plants in Houston for assembling and packaging robotics and integrating advanced instrumentation into oil field operations. GE Oil and Gas opened a technology center in Oklahoma City in October to place scientists closer to the oil fields to research and apply new digital industrial technologies for exploration and production. Among its many projects is an experiment to use drones to inspect equipment and identify methane leaks on oil sites. Nabors, the oil services giant, has 100 employees developing software, 10 times the number it had only a few years ago. With the adoption of all this   software and stuff, weve had to bring in a lot of new technicians, said Dennis A. Smith, a Nabors vice president. A typical new oil company employee is Andre Nel, a    mechanical engineer who is a rising star at Pioneer Natural Resources. In less than two years, he has helped rewrite computer software to instruct workers on the best designs for hydraulic fracturing, optimizing the amounts of fluids, sand and chemicals pumped into the wells. Now, connected by computers to technicians in the field, he is monitoring the production of 950 wells, instantly checking the maintenance history and production trends of every well with the click of a mouse. Im lucky and happy that the tech revolution in the oil field has created the need for engineers like me with backgrounds in computer science, he said. But smaller companies and their workers are struggling to keep up. S. O. C. Industries, a small local pump truck operator and chemical services provider, is forced to invest $100, 000 a year to keep up with the computer programs and monitoring equipment its clients request. The added expenses are one reason the company has let go 15 of the 60 field workers employed three years ago. Another is that well operators that once hired five or six people on a drill site to mix chemicals and drilling fluids as well as clean up spills are now hiring only three as mechanization has sliced their drilling time in half. Some of the remaining S. O. C. employees are straining to keep up with new computerized pump truck monitors and GPS systems. Its a struggle, said Rodrigo Urias, 59, an S. O. C. truck driver, who for many years only had to look at a needle on a gauge to monitor flow pressures. Now he needs to reset computer screens, take work orders on a computer tablet and sometimes do algebraic calculations. A lot of the guys cant operate these new technologies, tablets and instruments, and they keep whining, he added. They want to know why we cant do things like we used to.  Manufacturing executives say they are trying to minimize the complexity for field workers, and sometimes design their equipment with the advice of video game makers. Thats a good thing for Michael Manga, 34, an employee of Latshaw Drilling, an Oklahoma company active here. A college dropout, he knocked around from job to job before finding his way to the oil patch. Now, playing video games like Call of Duty and Mario Kart with his friends over the years has paid off, giving him the   coordination to monitor and operate the control panels and joy sticks that control the drilling rig. We do such a good job now, he said, were drilling ourselves out of a job.

The price of an   bag of seed corn rose to $300 from $80 in the last decade, as the companies that produced them consolidated, he said. And with the recent decline in commodity prices, Mr. Halcomb said he expects to lose $100 an acre this year. Were producing our crops at a loss now, just like the oil guys are pumping oil at a loss, Mr. Halcomb, who grows corn, soybeans, wheat and barley on his   family farm, said by telephone on Wednesday. You cant cut your costs fast enough.  It is a common plight of farmers across the United States, with the global agriculture industry in a wrenching downturn. Because farmers have produced too much corn, wheat and soybeans, they have been forced to slash prices to sell their crops. They have also reduced spending on seeds, pesticides and fertilizer, which has eaten into sales at agribusiness giants, including Monsanto and DuPont. In response, these companies have sought   deals to cut costs and weather the industrys storm. Four major agribusiness mergers have been announced in the last year. The latest is Bayer AGs $56 billion takeover of Monsanto     the largest acquisition of 2016     announced on Wednesday. Every merger creates the possibility of higher costs for farmers. Mr. Halcomb buys seeds with traits licensed to Monsanto of St. Louis and seeds from DuPont, which has a deal pending to merge with Dow Chemical. His fertilizers are made of potassium compounds and phosphate produced by Agrium of Calgary, Alberta, which on Monday agreed to combine with the fertilizer producer Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan. He uses pesticides made by Syngenta of Switzerland, which agreed in February to a takeover by the China National Chemical Corporation. Its just like any other industry that consolidates, Mr. Halcomb said. They tell the regulators theyre   and then they tell their customers they have to increase pricing after the deals done.  The companies say they are merging to diversify and increase growth and research capabilities, but these deals, given their size and scope, have already caught the attention of lawmakers and regulators in Washington. There is no guarantee that they will all receive regulatory approval, and some companies may have to sell assets to allay antitrust concerns. Dows merger with DuPont is under Justice Department review. The market seemed to anticipate hurdles for the Monsanto deal on Wednesday. Shares of the company closed about 20 percent lower than the $128 per share cash offer from Bayer, which is based in Leverkusen, Germany. Shares of each company gained less than 1 percent after the deal was announced. Adding the assumption of about $10 billion of Monsanto debt, Bayers total $66 billion pact is the largest   deal, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters, ahead of InBevs $60. 4 billion offer for another St.   company,   in June 2008. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, scheduled a hearing next week to discuss the possible effect of these   mergers on farming. Iowa produced more corn last year than any other state, according to the National Corn Growers Association. It seems to be catching fire and happening so fast with so many, Senator Grassley said in a phone interview. When you have less competition, prices go up.  European competition regulators also said publicly, before a   deal was even signed, that they would look at how it could affect prices and the availability of seed products, as well as research. Liam Condon, who leads Bayers   division, said in an interview that the company did an extensive analysis with regard to antitrust before approaching Monsanto in May. Mr. Condon said that he does not believe there is much overlap between their portfolios, because Bayers focus is largely on crop protection, while Monsantos is on seeds and traits. He said the companies assume they may need to sell off some assets to appease regulators. Monsanto, which is famous for its production of genetically modified seeds, rejected several offers from Bayer as too low. Wednesdays deal represented a 44 percent premium to Monsantos stock price on May 9, the day before Bayers interest in a deal surfaced. To assuage Monsantos concerns, Bayer threw in a $2 billion breakup fee if the deal fell apart on antitrust grounds. The strategic goal of the deal, according to Bill Selesky, an analyst at Argus Research, is to create a    experience for farmers, making Bayer the worlds largest supplier of seeds and farm chemicals. By improving the product for farmers, the combined company could ultimately raise prices, Mr. Selesky said in an interview. Senator Grassley said that he had spoken with a few farmers who believed the deals were necessary so large agribusinesses could continue to absorb the costs of researching and developing products and getting government approval for them. Bayer and Monsanto said they planned to cut about $1. 2 billion worth of costs as part of the deal, helping to improve efficiency. But Jim Benham of Versailles, Ind. the president of the Indiana Farmers Union, was not so optimistic. He blamed the rising costs of inputs     seeds, fertilizer and the like     for eating away at farmers profit margins, and warned that consolidation will make it worse. Costs have already risen by double digits over the last four to five years, and the proposed   merger could accelerate that. The merger is going to hurt the farmer, said Mr. Benham, who grows corn, soybeans and sometimes wheat on his   farm. The more consolidation we have on our inputs, the worse it gets.  Mr. Condon of Bayer said that the company would not raise prices without providing more value to farmers. This is a highly competitive industry, and just increasing prices without having any additional advantage or benefit for growers wont go anywhere, he said. Its up to us to show what were offering will help farmers improve their return on investment.  Some farmers said the consolidation could even enable prices to fall. Christine Hamilton manages a farm of more than 12, 000 acres in Kimball, S. D. growing crops like corn and operating a ranch. She said that if the deal can pass the antitrust screening, then maybe it could actually help farmers. I understand how companies need to get bigger in order to be competitive, she said. As we are in a low part of the cycle, anything that might have a chance of reducing our input prices would be great.

His name had popped up on the exchange bureaus computer system, along with those of members of Al Qaeda, the Islamic State and other militant groups responsible for shocking acts of violence. The only group the    father of three has ever belonged to, however, is Jehovahs Witnesses, a Christian denomination committed to the belief that the Bible must be taken literally, particularly its injunction Thou shalt not kill.  Yet, in a throwback to the days of the Soviet Union, when Jehovahs Witnesses were hounded as spies and malcontents by the K. G. B. the denomination is at the center of an escalating campaign by the authorities to curtail religious groups that compete with the Russian Orthodox Church and that challenge President Vladimir V. Putins efforts to rally the country behind traditional and often militaristic patriotic values. The Justice Ministry, in a preliminary adminstrative strike last month, put the headquarters of Jehovahs Witnesses in Russia, an office complex near St. Petersburg, on a list of the bodies banned in connection with the carrying out of extremist activities.  Whether it stays there will depend on Russias Supreme Court, which is scheduled to meet on Wednesday to hear a request from the Justice Ministry to outlaw the religious organization and stop its more than 170, 000 Russian members from spreading extremist texts. Extremism, as defined by a law passed in 2002 but amended and expanded several times since, has become a catchall charge that can be deployed against just about anybody, as it has been against some of those involved in recent   protests in Moscow and scores of other cities. Several students who took part in demonstrations in the Siberian city of Tomsk are now being investigated by a special   unit, while Leonid Volkov, the senior aide to the jailed protest leader Aleksei A. Navalny, said he himself was detained last week under the extremism law. In the case of Jehovahs Witnesses, the putative extremism seems to derive mostly from the groups absolute opposition to violence, a stand that infuriated Soviet and now Russian authorities whose legitimacy rests in large part on the celebration of martial triumphs, most notably over Nazi Germany in World War II but also over rebels in Syria. Jehovahs Witnesses, members of a denomination founded in the United States in the 19th century and active in Russia for more than 100 years, refuse military service, do not vote and view God as the only true leader. They shun the patriotic festivals promoted with gusto by the Kremlin, like the annual celebration of victory in 1945 and recent events to celebrate the annexation of Crimea in March 2014. Mr. Sivak, who says he lost his job as a physical education teacher because of his role as a Jehovahs Witnesses elder, said he voted for Mr. Putin in 2000, three years before joining the denomination. He added that while he had not voted since, nor had he supported   activities of the sort that usually attract the attention of Russias   version of the K. G. B. the Federal Security Service, or F. S. B. I have absolutely no interest in politics, he said during a recent Jehovahs Witnesses Friday service in a wooden country house in Vorokhobino, a   village north of Moscow. Around 100 worshipers crammed into a long, chilly room under fluorescent lights to listen to readings from the Bible, sing and watch a video advising them to dress for worship as they would for a meeting with the president. From the Russian states perspective, Jehovahs Witnesses are completely separate, said Geraldine Fagan, the author of Believing in Russia     Religious Policy After Communism.  She added, They dont get involved in politics, but this is itself seen as a suspicious political deviation.  The idea of independent and public religious activity that is completely outside the control of     and also indifferent to     the state sets all sorts of alarm bells ringing in the Orthodox Church and the security services, she said. That the worldwide headquarters of Jehovahs Witnesses is in the United States and that its publications are mostly prepared there, Ms. Fagan added, all adds up to a big conspiracy theory for the increasingly assertive F. S. B. For Mr. Sivak, it has added up to a long legal nightmare. His troubles began, he said, when undercover security officers posed as worshipers and secretly filmed a service where he was helping to officiate in 2010. Accused of inciting hatred and disparaging the human dignity of citizens, he was put on trial for extremism along with a second elder, Vyacheslav Stepanov, 40. The prosecutors case, heard by a municipal court in Sergiyev Posad, a center of the Russian Orthodox Church, produced no evidence of extremism and focused instead on the insufficient patriotism of Jehovahs Witnesses. Their disregard for the state, a report prepared for the prosecution said, erodes any sense of civic affiliation and promotes the destruction of national and state security.  In a ruling last year, the court found the two men not guilty, and their ordeal seemed over     until Mr. Sivak tried to change money and was told that he had been placed on a list of terrorists and extremists.  He and Mr. Stepanov now face new charges of extremism and are to appear before a regional court this month. There is a big wave of repression breaking, Mr. Stepanov said. In response to written questions, the Justice Ministry in Moscow said a yearlong review of documents at the Jehovahs Witnesses administrative center near St. Petersburg had uncovered violations of a Russian law banning extremism. As a result, it added, the center should be liquidated, along with nearly 400 locally registered branches of the group and other structures. For the denominations leaders in Russia, the sharp escalation in a long campaign of harassment, previously driven mostly by local officials, drew horrifying flashbacks to the Soviet era. Vasily Kalin, the chairman of Jehovahs Witnesses Russian arm, recalled that his whole family had been deported to Siberia when he was a child. It is sad and reprehensible that my children and grandchildren should be facing a similar fate, he said. Never did I expect that we would again face the threat of religious persecution in modern Russia.  In Russia, as in many countries, the    proselytizing of Jehovahs Witnesses often causes irritation, and their theological idiosyncrasies disturb many mainstream Christians. The group has also been widely criticized for saying that the Bible prohibits blood transfusions. But it has never promoted violent or even peaceful political resistance. I cannot imagine that anyone really thinks they are a threat, said Alexander Verkhovsky, director of the SOVA Center for Information and Analysis, which monitors extremism in Russia. But they are seen as a good target. They are pacifists, so they cannot be radicalized, no matter what you do to them. They can be used to send a message.  That message, it would seem, is that everyone needs to get with the Putin program     or risk being branded as an extremist for displaying indifference, never mind hostility, to the Kremlins drive to make Russia a great power again. A big reason they are being targeted is simply that they are an easy target, Ms. Fagan said. They dont vote, so nobody is going to lose votes by attacking them.  Attacking Jehovahs Witnesses also sends a signal that even the mildest deviation from the norm, if proclaimed publicly and insistently, can be punished under the   law, which was passed after Russias second war in Chechnya and the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States. Billed as a move by Russia to join a worldwide struggle against terrorism, the law prohibited incitement of racial, national or religious strife, and social hatred associated with violence or calls for violence.  But the reference to violence was later deleted, opening the way for the authorities to classify as extremist any group claiming to offer a unique, true path to religious or political salvation. Even the Russian Orthodox Church has sometimes fallen afoul of the law: The slogan Orthodoxy or Death!     a rallying cry embraced by some   believers     has been banned as an illegal extremist text. To help protect the Orthodox Church and other established religions, Parliament passed a law in 2015 to exempt the Bible and the Quran, as well as Jewish and Buddhist scripture, from charges of extremism based on their claims to offer the only true faith. The main impetus for the current crackdown, however, appears to come from the security services, not the Orthodox Church. Roman Lunkin, director of the Institute of Religion and Law, a Moscow research group, described it as part of a broad policy of suppressing all nongovernmental organizations that has gained particular force because of the highly centralized structure of Jehovahs Witnesses under a worldwide leadership based in the United States. They are controlled from outside Russia, and this is very suspicious for our secret services, he said. They dont like having an organization that they do not and cannot control.  Artyom Grigoryan, a former Jehovahs Witness who used to work at the groups Russian headquarters but who now follows the Orthodox Church, said the organization had many positive elements, like its ban on excessive drinking, smoking and other unhealthy habits. All the same, he said it deserved to be treated with suspicion. Look at it from the view of the state, he said. Here is an organization that is run from America, that gets financing from abroad, and whose members dont serve in the army and dont vote.  Estranged from his parents, who are still members and view his departure as sinful, he said Jehovahs Witnesses broke up families and in the logic of the state, it presents a threat.  He added, I am not saying this is real or not, but it needs to be checked by objective experts.  Mr. Sivak, now preparing for yet another trial, said that he had always tried to follow the law and that he respected the state, but could not put its interests above the commands of his faith. They say I am a terrorist, he said, but all I ever wanted to do was to get people to pay attention to the Bible.

Prior to the election, I described the period of time ending on January 20th as the danger zone, and my outlook has not changed just because Donald Trump was victorious on election night. As you will see, the next two months are an absolutely critical time, and if we can get through January 20th without something major happening perhaps we can breathe a little bit easier (at least for a while). On the other hand, the events of the next two months could easily plunge this country into a period of unprecedented chaos. A lot of people are feeling really good about things right now because of Trumps victory, but now is definitely not a time to relax and let down our guard. \nAnd the truth is that Donald Trump has not even won the presidency yet. As I detailed shortly before election night , the next president will not be determined until December 19th when the Electoral College meets. \nOn Monday, December 19th the members of the Electoral College will gather in all 50 state capitals to cast their votes for president. It is then, and only then, that the next president of the United States will be elected. \nThroughout our history, electors have followed the will of the people more than 99 perfect of the time, but there have been faithless electors before, and if Democrats can get enough of them to switch sides in December it is still possible (though not probable) that Hillary Clinton could win the election. \nOne petition that is asking electors to switch their votes has already been signed by more than 4 million people. The petition claims that Donald Trump is unfit to serve as president, and that since Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by a wide margin she should be elected president instead. The following comes from a USA Today article entitled  Could the Electoral College elect Hillary Clinton instead of Donald Trump?  \nA Change.org petition, now signed by more than 4.3 million people, encourages members of the Electoral College to cast their votes for Hillary Clinton when the college meets on Dec. 19. The petition argues that Donald Trump is unfit to serve and that Secretary Clinton WON THE POPULAR VOTE and should be President. \nIf they all vote the way their states voted, Donald Trump will win, the petition states. However, they can vote for Hillary Clinton if they choose. Even in states where that is not allowed, their vote would still be counted, they would simply pay a small fine  which we can be sure Clinton supporters will be glad to pay! We are calling on the Electors to ignore their states votes and cast their ballots for Secretary Clinton. \nPersonally, I dont believe that this is going to happen. They may be able to flip a few electors, but the gap in electoral votes is almost certainly too wide for the Democrats to overcome. \nHowever, that is not the only concern we are facing. Ever since his victory on November 8th, there have been a multitude of violent threats against Donald Trump and his family. And without a doubt, there are a lot of very powerful people that would be very interested in finding a way to keep Donald Trump from getting to Inauguration Day. So let us pray for his safety and for the safety of his family. \nIf Donald Trump were to be incapacitated after he wins the Electoral College vote on December 19th, Mike Pence would take his place. \nBut if something were to happen to him before December 19th, his electors would be free to vote for another candidate  including Hillary Clinton. \nIf everything goes smoothly and Donald Trump successfully makes it to Inauguration Day, he could be facing one of the biggest political protests in United States history. \nIn an article for The Most Important News , I showed that the far left is calling for thousands upon thousands of protesters to descend upon Washington D.C. on January 20th in order to disrupt the Inauguration festivities as much as possible. \nThis giant protest is being organized by the usual suspects, and they have already put up Facebook pages , websites , and the hashtag #DisruptJ20 is being widely used all over social media. \nTraditionally Inauguration Day is a day of joy and celebration, but the far left seems intent on transforming it into a massive riot. \nLet us hope that they are not successful. \nAnother reason why we will be in the danger zone over the next two months is because of what Barack Obama may choose to do at the United Nations. \nNow that it looks like Donald Trump is going to be our next president, the international pressure on Barack Obama to do something at the United Nations regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict before the end of his term has become even more intense. \nAnd this is something that Trump and his advisers are actively concerned about. In fact, I came across an article earlier today that discussed the fact that the Trump team is warning Obama against making moves on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in his last months in office  \nSaying that pushing agendas contrary to the president-elects position would not be in the spirit of the transition, Trump national security advisor for Donald Trump last week warned the Obama administration against making moves on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in his last months in office. \nOn big, transformative issues where President Obama and President-elect Trump are not in alignment, I dont think its in keeping with the spirit of the transitionto try to push through agenda items that are contrary to the president-elects positions, the advisor told Politico . \nSpecifically, the concern is that Obama may decide to support a UN Security Council resolution that would officially recognize a Palestinian state, set the parameters for a two state solution, and establish East Jerusalem as the capital for the new Palestinian state. \nJust a few weeks ago, an article in the Wall Street Journal entitled  Obamas Israel Surprise?  reported that this is one of the options that the Obama administration is strongly considering right now. A UN Security Council resolution would be legally binding on both Israel and the Palestinians, and it would be something that President Trump would not be able to undo. \nThe rest of the UN Security Council is eager to support such a resolution, and so the decision about whether this resolution is going to happen or not sits in the hands of Barack Obama, and at this moment we do not know what he is going to do. The following comes from an article by Leo Hohmann  \nThe Wall Street Journal reported one week before Tuesdays election that Obama had requested his aides provide him with a list of options to deal with the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. \nIsraeli diplomats, according to the WSJ story, are preparing for the possibility that a lame-duck President Obama may try to force a diplomatic resolution for Israel and the Palestinians at the United Nations. \nThe president is presumably now reviewing those options, which number about half a dozen. \nHe may be preparing to recognize a Palestinian state at the U.N. before he leaves office , WSJ reported. \nIf Barack Obama decides to divide the land of Israel at the United Nations, it will be the worst decision of his entire presidency. I have warned repeatedly that all hell will break loose in America if it happens, and it will also mean that many of the events that I warn about in my latest book are much closer than many had been anticipating. \nBut if we can get to January 20th and the land of Israel has not been divided yet, we may be able to rest easy for at least a little while, because Trump has already said that he would not support a UN Security Council resolution that forces a solution on the Israelis and Palestinians. \nWhen politicians are going to do something that they know people wont like, they tend to try to sneak it through around the holidays when a lot of people arent paying attention. For example, yesterday I discussed how the legislation that created the Federal Reserve was rushed through Congress right before Christmas in 1913 . \nSo keep an eye on the period around Thanksgiving and the period around Christmas. If Barack Obama is going to stab Israel in the back, it may happen during one of those times. \nMy hope is that we can get through January 20th without anything going seriously wrong. If that happens, I know that I will be very thankful. \nAnd as I detailed in a previous article , Donald Trump will be 70 years, 7 months and 7 days old on his first full day in office on January 21st, and that will happen in year 5777 on the Hebrew calendar. \nCould that be a sign of better things ahead as many believe? \nOr will the next two months set off a chain of events that will be absolutely disastrous for this nation? \nI believe that this is an absolutely critical moment in our history, and let us hope that our leaders make the right decisions. \nDanger Zone Brings back memories of Kenny Loggins and Top Gun. anonymous \nListen to her howlin roar Metal under tension Beggin you to touch and go Highway to the Danger Zone Ride into the Danger Zone Headin into twilight Spreadin out her wings tonight She got you jumpin off the deck And shovin into overdrive Highway to the Danger Zone Ill take you Right into the Danger Zone William Lutz \nI will not celebrate the holidays this year!

Although I visit this site fairly often, it is showing signs of paranoia and provoking fear. When George W. as elected, there were many protesters, they were just hidden away in free speech zones. Of course there are many unhappy people, as there were in 2000, and every election. Trumps votes were less than 19% of the 325 million people in the country. Will Trump bring jobs. No, not unless they are govt employees, or funded by taxes. There is only one way jobs are created, and that is when there is demand for products and services. A lot of people with their low paying jobs can hardly afford the basic necessities, let alone keep playing the consumerism game.

Mondobeyondo \nYes, there is still a possibility that Hillary Clinton could still get in the Oval Office. But a Trump presidency is pretty much a done deal (knock on wood). The Secret Service had better guard him and his family VERY closely. From what Ive seen and heard, President Obama is trying to make Trumps transition to the presidency very peaceful and orderly (even though they hate each other). Lets hope that Trumps presidency will be a successful one, and that it heals the many divisions and other issues that plague our country.

A small group had concentrated into their own hands an almost complete control over other peoples property, other peoples money, other peoples labor  other peoples lives. For too many of us life was no longer free; liberty no longer real; men could no longer follow the pursuit of happiness. \nAgainst economic tyranny such as this, the American citizen could appeal only to the organized power of government.  \nYou many not agree with this approach but ALL the evidence shows wealth inequality is at all time highs. Most of you right wingers claim we have too much socialism and communism in this country.

But one has to assume they are apoplectic over their failure in Syria. Billions of dollars and years wasted all because people have direct access to information unfiltered out of Syria. \nIt should have a completely unremarkable US regime change operation: \n* Send in the NGOs to agitate locals * Make promises of support for attacks on the government by the sole world superpower * Get selectively edited footage of your collaborators on the ground being attacked by the government(after they attacked the government) * Pump out mass amounts of propaganda based off that footage: \"Simple farmers rising up to overthrow a brutal regime!\" * Wield the tremendous economic power of the US to ensure the vast majority of smaller countries are on board with military action sanctioned by the UN * Flood the country with arms for anyone no matter how crazy to attack the government * Fake chemical attacks, US intelligence agency compromised UN reports and inspectors, etc. \nAll of that derailed by nothing more than people having direct access to information uncensored out of Syria. \nI think it is safe to assume the US intelligence agencies are actively working on ways to make it illegal or impossible for anyone to publish, share, or consume 'unauthorized' information from countries that are targets of regime change. \nThe easiest way would be to designate any source of information not actively working with or approved by the US intelligence agencies will be increasingly labeled as 'terror propaganda' and US social media and Internet providers will be required to censor or shutdown any such sources.

The narrator traveled by train across the country. A train line that was originally built in the 1870s by Spain to divide the country for defensive and control purposes. The locomotives pulling the passenger cars were 1950s USA manufactured vintage and date to a time when our Federal Government had good economic relations with the Batista Regiem. \nWhen I think of the cruel and unusual economic punishment dished out to Cuba by our Federal Government all I can see is a bunch of financially poor peasants who bear the brunt of U.S. economic warfare. Just as in the Middle East and now Europe economic sanction wars hurt the farmer, the small business operator, the basic family unit, etc., while rich people get richer. Isn't it about time to back off on the economic war against Cuba and the rest of the Planet?

George Washington only had four departments in his administration as first President of the United States. \nPerhaps if Mr. Trump can't find suitable candidates for his cabinet when he \"drains the swamp\", he could assume the role as interim department head until such time as qualified non-militarists emerge from the private sector to serve in his administration.

My point is, that this possible (how probable--that is totally another discussion) civil unrest, once \"red\" states America gets involved seriously, will not last too long for a number of purely tactical, operational and logistical reasons. This is if to discount the possibility of law enforcement actually enforcing the law and order which may, under certain conditions, turn very violent against those who will try to undermine constitutional process. Blue states can not win for mostly cultural reasons since, as I already stated, \"Red\" states' America is simply armed on several orders of magnitude better and is really angry. It is also tougher.

He is the man behind such viral headlines as The Amish in America Commit their Vote to Donald Trump and President Obama Signs Executive Order Banning the National Anthem at all Sporting Events Nationwide  neither of which were true. \nMy sites were picked up by Trump supporters all the time. I think Trump is in the White House because of me. His followers dont fact-check anything  theyll post everything, believe anything.

Rule by monopolistic global corporations, at best, supports 20% of the population in the short term. It enriches the ruling elite and their servants and improvises everyone else. In the long term, climate change or a nuclear war, brought on by the blind needs of greed, will end the world as we know it. Brexit and the Trump Presidency proved that globalism and democracy are incompatible. For globalism to proceed in the middle term, it will require a surveillance police state, total propaganda, reeducation camps and the shutdown of this bar.

I think at least Western Syria will be cleansed of jihadis as a result. \nBut Trump might be a little more hard nosed in the future. After the tensions are dialed down and having the score at basically Russia 1, US 0, he's not going to be so pliable. He sure as fuck isn't going to throw Israel under a bus. He's not going to roll over on all American commitments in the region. \nTrump's been getting a complete rundown on the big picture. It's no secret that until recently he couldn't have found Damascus on a map. Now he knows about the Shiite Crescent and how the arms can flow from Iran to Syria to Hezbollah in Lebanon in volumes like never before and how upsetting that is for Israel. \nNow there's action towards taking Raqqa by the Kurds and who knows who else. The US and its posse will provide the air cover and logistics plus lots of special ops once it kicks in. I'm surprised the Kurds bit again after taking it up the arse from the US a couple of months ago They're not going all in right now as things are ongoing in Mosul and will be for a while. But you don't hear Assad and the Russians squawking much about it. It's like they both know that parts of Eastern Syria are bye-bye. \nTrump's good will towards Russia certainly doesn't extend to Iran. And no American will ever call Hezbollah anything bur a terrorist organization after the Marine barracks truck bombing in Beirut all those years ago. If Putin and Trump are going to come to a general understanding in the ME there's going to have to be some give and take. \nPutin's done quite a turnaround in taking Russia from a pariah state a couple of years ago to the player on the world sage that it is now. It's looking good for him to keep his man in power in Syria and to establish a permanent presence in the ME with Khmeimim and Tartus. Once Trump is fully up to speed on the totality of American interests in the region he is bound by his office not to walk away from them. There will have to be some serious deal-making.

The coming of Putin was a direct result of NATO's 1999 aggression against Yugoslavia, while War of 08-08-08 was the start of Russia's return into big league. So, it is not a \"couple of years\". Results of War of 080808 actually stunned DC's neocon interventionist cabal.

Luis Gutierrez (  ) made the rounds on MSBNC and CNN, dismissing President Donald Trumps offer to help Chicago end gun violence, and blaming the NRA for the death and mayhem currently marring the Windy City. [Gutierrez was reacting to Trumps description of the carnage in Chicago and his pledge to intervene federally if city leaders fail to stop the violence. On January 24 Trump tweeted:  If Chicago doesnt fix the horrible carnage going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016) I will send in the Feds!     Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017,  The following day, Gutierrez appeared on All In With Chris Hayes and said, [President Trump] tweets about the carnage and that hes going to send the feds in. Did he send any extra money for police officers? We could use that, for training.  He noted that Trump is increasing the number of Border Patrol agents on the southern border and said Chicago would like to have more federal agents   ATF and FBI   in the city as well. Then Gutierrez said: But      [President Trump is] with the NRA. The NRA that endorsed him, [that is]      so part of his relationship. You know that NRA did? It crippled the laws of the city of Chicago and the courts, so that we cannot keep guns off our streets. The next day Gutierrez appeared on CNN, where he was again asked about Trumps carnage assessment and his pledge to send in the feds if Chicago city leaders fail to end the violence. Gutierrez said: Heres the hypocrisy of it all. The fact is, Donald Trump loves the NRA. And during his campaign he embraced them and they embraced him. The city of Chicago had some of the most stringent gun control laws, how were they eviscerated? Because the NRA funded lawsuits against our gun control measures. Gutierrez ignores the fact that Chicago had some its highest annual murder rates while all the citys gun controls were place. For example, the Chicago Police Department reports 921 murders during 1991, 940 during 1992. 850 during 2993, and 930 during 1994. These excessively high murder numbers all occurred while Chicagos ban on handgun ownership was in place. Viewed in this light, the 762 murders CNN reported for 2016 were a far cry from some of the murder numbers witnessed while Chicagos most stringent gun controls were in effect.

Carroll","text":"This article originally ran in April. We are resurfacing it in light of new guidelines from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases that advise giving peanuts to children early and often as a strategy to forestall an allergy.  It has become an article of faith among many women I know to eliminate some foods during pregnancy, out of concern that their children could become allergic to them: shellfish, dairy and, most of all, peanuts. After their babies arrive, they continue to abstain from certain foods while   and they certainly keep their children from eating them. But research in the last few years has consistently shown that all this avoidance often does more harm than good. In many cases, we need to be doing the opposite. Mothers didnt adopt this behavior out of nowhere. In 2000, the American Academy of Pediatrics released guidelines on reducing a childs risk for developing allergies. They recommended that mothers eliminate peanuts and tree nuts (e. g. almonds, walnuts, etc.) and consider eliminating eggs, cows milk, fish, and perhaps other foods from their diets while nursing.  Further, they recommended that children at high risk for allergies be given no solid foods until six months of age, no dairy products until 1 year old, no eggs until age 2, and no peanuts, nuts or fish until age 3. A debate has been raging in the health care system for decades on this topic. I was part of a systematic review that examined the relationship between early solid food introduction and allergic disease in children. We found no good evidence to support the idea that being exposed to solid foods earlier led to persistent food allergies. To its credit, the A. A. P. changed its recommendations based on new research. In 2008, updated guidelines reported that maternal restrictions in pregnancy or   no longer seemed like advice that should be widely recommended. It also acknowledged that there didnt seem much reason to delay the introduction of allergy foods like peanuts after six months, around the age babies move from milk or formula to a wider range of food. Unfortunately, this did little to change peoples behavior. Many had already internalized the advice. It seemed logical to them that avoiding foods would give children less of a chance to develop allergies. If it was still a good idea not to expose children until they were six months old, why not keep going? A study published in The New England Journal of Medicine last year turned all of this on its head. Researchers enrolled 640 infants at high risk for allergies, between 4 and 11 months of age, in a trial and randomized them to one of two groups. One of them was to avoid peanut protein the other was to eat at least six grams of peanut protein a week given in three or more meals. All participants were followed until they were 5 years old. What was most surprising in this work was that 15 percent of the infants already had evidence of peanut sensitivity by allergy testing. They were enrolled in the trial despite this, and half of them were given peanut extract every week. The results were remarkable. At the end of the study, about 3 percent of those exposed to peanuts had developed a peanut allergy, compared with more than 17 percent among those who avoided peanuts. More surprising, if you looked just at the children who already had evidence of peanut sensitivity when they were babies, fewer than 11 percent of those regularly exposed to peanuts developed an allergy. But more than 35 percent of those who avoided peanuts developed an allergy. Children who had proven sensitivity to peanuts, but consumed them in their diet regularly, were less likely to develop a peanut allergy than children without sensitivity who avoided them. Recently,   results were published. After the trial ended, researchers asked all the participants who had been regularly consuming peanuts to avoid them for the next 12 months. At the end of that period, when the children were 6, there was no significant increase in new peanut allergies in that group. Avoidance at this point made no difference. The critical need for exposure appears to be somewhere from infancy until age 5. These results were so convincing that, once again, experts are changing their recommendations. In September 2015, the A. A. P.     along with others     argued that health care providers should recommend introducing   products into the diets of   infants early on in life.  These changes dovetail nicely within what has become known as the hygiene hypothesis, the gist of which is that as weve made our environment more and more sterile, our immune systems develop differently than they used to. Without exposure to outside things to fight, our defenses turn inward and toward more benign substances, leading to increased levels of eczema, asthma and allergies. Of course, many people used to die from infections that no longer threaten us because of advances, so no one should take this as a call for living in filth. Nor should anyone take these recent findings as advice to feed babies and small children peanuts and other foods without concern. All changes to an infants diet, especially in children with allergies, should be done in consultation with a health care professional. As with many things in health care, however, we went too far with our response to peanut and other food allergies. Avoidance is sometimes needed for those with severe reactions. When we apply those same rules to everyone else, however, things can backfire.","label":0,"_deepnote_index_column":39},{"id":40,"title":"MRI Shows Detailed Images of 20-Week Unborn Babies - Breitbart","author":"Dr. Susan Berry","text":"A newly developed MRI scan allows parents to see detailed images of the beating heart of even a   unborn baby, as well as clear pictures of the baby stretching its legs and even swallowing in the womb. [The new scan, developed by a   team of medical researchers, could replace the somewhat grainy ultrasound images parents are more accustomed to viewing during pregnancy.  UK video parenting site ChannelMum is sharing the video, created by the iFind project, which shows an MRI scan of a baby at 20 weeks. Cathy Ranson, who edits the site, says, Scans are amazing as they help mums, dads and even other family members bond with their baby.     There is nothing quite as emotional as seeing your unborn child moving inside you, and these MRI scans are taking images to the next level, she adds. They are truly breathtaking.  According to the Daily Mail, the new scan is also revving up the abortion debate in the UK once again since, with the new technology, parents and doctors can see clearly how fully formed an unborn baby is at 20 weeks. Currently, the legal abortion limit in the UK is 24 weeks. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has previously supported slashing the limit to 12 weeks and there have also been calls to reduce it to 20 weeks, says the report. With a   administration now in the White House in the United States, national leaders who oppose abortion are hoping to pass the   Unborn Child Protection Act, which would ban most abortions past the   mark, into law. Dr. David Lloyd, a clinical research fellow at Kings College London who has participated in the project, says, Taking pictures of a 20 week fetus while theyre still in the womb really isnt that easy.  He explains: For one thing, theyre very small. The fetal heart, for example, with all of its tiny chambers and valves, is only about 15mm long: less than the size of penny. Ultrasound technology     used in all routine antenatal scans in the UK     is actually fairly good at visualising these tiny structures. It uses very high frequency sound waves which are reflected back (echo) from the structures inside the body to produce an image. The MRI scan, unlike an ultrasound, shows what is happening under the babys skin, so that images can be obtained even of babies who move around frequently. In fetal ultrasound, the images produced can be excellent, but unfortunately, thats not true for every patient, Lloyd continues. Ultrasound has to be able to see through the body to the parts of the baby we want to image, and that isnt always easy. It will depend on the age of the baby, how they are lying in the womb, the size of the mother, and many other factors.  MRI, which uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce images, isnt so limited, he explains. It can see the structures inside the body regardless of whether theres bone, muscle or fat in the way and in some cases it can give us even more detailed images than ultrasound.  Importantly, it is also one of the few imaging techniques that is safe to use in pregnancy, Lloyd adds.","label":0,"_deepnote_index_column":40},{"id":41,"title":"4 of the Best Kinds of Milk That Arent Dairy","author":"Alexandria Laredo","text":"  Now, numerous studies have concluded that milk doesnt actually build bone and provide the same amount of calcium that we thought. A study published in the British Medical Journal , for example, followed more than 100,000 people in Sweden over periods of 20 to 30 years, with shocking results: The people who drank milk were more likely to die from heart disease and cancer. The women suffered more overall fractures and hip fractures as well. Different studies have also shown that higher dairy intake is linked to higher risks of prostate and ovarian cancer and can trigger type 1 diabetes. It is also linked to forms of acne, just to name a few effects. There is also the disturbing side of the dairy industry, where animals are abused to produce the milk we drink. A lot of dairy products are filled with the hormones that were given to female cows to keep them perpetually lactating so they produce an endless flow of milk. This doctor describes it perfectly when he says cows milk is for baby calfs, just like human milk is for babies. It is a substance we need while in crucial stages of development, but past a certain age, it becomes obsolete. While there are many alternatives to dairy milk, some are much better than others. Here are some of the better milk products out there. Almond Milk Raw organic almond milk is a great choice when you know where its coming from. As with many mass produced products, even some almond milks arent the best for us. An analysis of a UK almond milk brand showed that nuts make up only 2% of the drink itself. A single serving of almond milk has almost no protein. Compared with plain old almonds, it fares even worse. There is one place where almond milk comes out on top, of course: It has more potassium and more of the vitamins A and D. But almond milk is fortified with these nutrients  theyve been added during the production process. Making almond milk yourself, however, is a fantastic option, and allows you to control exactly what goes inside it, ensuring there are no additives, preservatives, or substances youve never even heard of before. Rice Milk Rice milk is another good choice that works well as a dairy substitute, if you dont mind the taste. Its higher in carbohydrates than other milk choices and contains around the same amount of calcium as cows milk. Yet it contains almost no protein, so it needs to be balanced with other protein rich foods. During processing, the carbs break down into sugars and give the milk a sweet taste. It is filled with more sugar, around 10 grams for one serving, which is a lot more than something like coconut milk, which has around 3 grams. If youre trying to have as little sugar as possible, rice milk may not be the best choice, but its certainly better than plain old dairy milk. Coconut Milk Coconut milk is definitely one of the healthier options here. When this milk is all natural, meaning theres no added sugars, natural flavours, or preservatives, it is incredibly healthy for us.  Coconuts are highly nutritious and rich in fibre, vitamins C, E, B1, B3, B5 and B6 and minerals including iron, selenium, sodium, calcium, magnesium and phosphorous. The things that makes coconuts so good is the type of fat they contain. They have a form of medium-chain fatty acids rather than long-chain fatty acids, which are stored in our tissue for much longer. One of the beneficial acids within coconuts is called lauric acid. This gets converted inside the body into a beneficial substance called monolaurin acid, which acts as an antiviral agent. But unlike other milks, if you have access, you can go right up to a coconut tree and drink the milk straight from the coconut without the need for processing. This is one of the most pure and fresh ways to get some milk in you! Hemp Milk Ah, hemp; one of the most versatile plants on our planet. Hemp milk has a wide range of health benefits that a lot of other milks dont. Some companies make fully organic, non-GMO, and unsweetened hemp milk, but its always good to check exactly where youre getting your products from. Hemp milk has a more bean-like and nutty flavor to it, which still tastes great in many drinks or foods. Its also packed with healthy omega-3 fatty acids, which help with our heart health. In a single 8-ounce glass of hemp milk you can find the following nutrients: Vitamin A","label":1,"_deepnote_index_column":41},{"id":42,"title":"Ryan Lochte Dropped by Speedo USA and Other Retailers - The New York Times","author":"Katie Rogers","text":"The fallout from Ryan Lochtes story about being robbed at gunpoint in Rio     a tale the Brazilian police said was not true     continued Monday when four companies said they would end business partnerships with Mr. Lochte, an American swimmer and   Olympic medalist. After a week of intense international media attention and anger in Brazil, the financial repercussions were swift for Mr. Lochte as Speedo USA, the luxury clothing retailer Ralph Lauren and the mattress company Airweave all announced that they would part ways with him. And Syneron Candela, a company that sells   devices, told Reuters its relationship with the swimmer ended on Sunday. Speedo USA said in a message on Twitter that it would instead donate a $50, 000 portion of Mr. Lochtes fee to a charity to help Brazilian children. While we have enjoyed a winning relationship with Ryan for over a decade and he has been an important member of the Speedo team, we cannot condone behavior that is counter to the values this brand has long stood for, the company said in its statement. On Monday, Kim Angelastro, a spokeswoman for Syneron Candela, wrote in an email, We hold our employees to high standards, and we expect the same of our business partners.  Mr. Lochte was a spokesman for the companys Gentle Hair Removal brand. Through a spokeswoman, Ralph Lauren said Monday that Mr. Lochtes endorsement agreement with the clothing company had been for only the 2016 Olympics, and that his contract would not be renewed. Airweave said on Twitter that after careful consideration, we have made the decision to end our partnership with Ryan Lochte.  The decisions to cut ties with Mr. Lochte, 32, were the first major signs of the financial fallout for him. For the past week, he has been at the center of an international firestorm after the Brazilian police said he and three other American athletes     Jimmy Feigen, Jack Conger and Gunnar Bentz     had fabricated the account of being robbed after a   party in Rio de Janeiro. The authorities said that the swimmers had instead drunkenly vandalized a gas station bathroom, paying a security guard about $50 for the damage before leaving. Mr. Lochte originally said that the car they were traveling in had been stopped by armed men, who held a gun to his head. But his story later changed. A Brazilian judge ordered the swimmers to remain in Rio, but Mr. Lochte had already left the country. After Mr. Conger and Mr. Bentz were pulled from their flight to the United States, they told the police that the confrontation began when Lochte pulled a poster off a gas station wall. Mr. Feigen, 26, later donated $10, 800 to a charity in Rio that teaches martial arts to poor children. Mr. Lochte first issued an apology on social media     I should have been much more responsible for how I handled myself, he wrote     then told Matt Lauer in an interview on NBC that he had been intoxicated and that he had overexaggerated that story.  He has maintained that he was held at gunpoint. All we know is that there was a gun pointed in our direction, and we were demanded to give money, Mr. Lochte said. Mr. Lochte, whose boyish and sometimes oafish personality had made him a commercial success in Olympics past, had headed into Rio with fewer sponsors than hed had at the London Games, according to a report by CNN Money. Mr. Lochte took home a gold medal in the   freestyle relay in Rio.","label":0,"_deepnote_index_column":42},{"id":43,"title":"Can I have one girlfriend without you bastards f**king it up? asks Harry","author":"nan","text":"Can I have one girlfriend without you bastards f**king it up? asks Harry 08-11-16 \nPRINCE Harry has asked the worlds media if he could just have one relationship that is not immediately ruined by bastard journalists. \nThe prince has released a letter to the media asking if they could just one time not steam straight into a new girlfriends life and bollocks it all up. \nHe continued: Seriously you fuckers, the prince thing only gets you so far when shes getting a hundred texts her day about her mum being followed by stubbly, fag-scented photographers. \nAnd I do not need every newspaper in Britain muttering words like Compton and ghetto like a horrendously prejudiced grandparent.

[During the Obama administration, the Division served purely ideological ends with rigidity unmatched in other federal offices. Entrenched federal bureaucrats jettisoned precepts like equal enforcement in favor of political and racialized dogmas with a zeal that risks litigation failure and invites court sanctions, the letter states.  Signed by such conservative heavyweights as Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, the letter paints a picture of a Division ripe for sweeping reform after eight years under Obama during which The Civil Rights Division has relegated its leadership role to political activists.  Hiring practices for the career staff of the Division is one of the letters chief concerns. While Tom Perez, now head of the Democratic National Committee, was the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, the Division was the subject of an Inspector Generals review that found the Obama Justice Departments insistence that   have a demonstrated commitment to civil rights led to a perception only   activists need apply. In this case, perception and reality were synonymous, the letter insists, noting instances in which Division employees leaked confidential information to civil rights groups, and Perezs subsequent refusal to implement any of the reports hiring recommendations. Also among the letters complaints is the alleged culture of politically motivated bullying that was fostered during the Obama years. The same Inspector Generals Report found a pattern of personal attacks against, for example, employees who were openly Christian.  J. Christian Adams, President of the Public Interest Legal Foundation and a signatory of the letter, added, For years, a radicalized Civil Rights Division   advanced leftists causes with respect to voting, law enforcement, immigration, and others while constitutional Rule of Law was considered a nuisance. General Sessions has an opportunity to begin the course correction necessary to protect all Americans from civil rights abuses.  In picking a new head for the Civil Rights Division, the letters signatories hope Attorney General Sessions will look for a reformer prepared to return to   civil rights enforcement and tackle the Divisions entrenched cultural problems.

One of the people said that the details of the allegations, while unverified, were troubling enough that they left 21st Century Fox little choice but to force an end to Mr. Ailess reign as chairman and chief executive of Fox News, given the potential liability they presented to the company both legally and in terms of its own corporate culture. The people with knowledge of the state of discussions over Mr. Ailess exit agreement said both sides were working toward an accommodation that would recognize Mr. Ailess service to the company as the founder and leader of Fox News, which sits atop the cable news ratings and is a major profit engine for 21st Century Fox. The agreement could also include a provision for him to continue with Fox as a consultant. But given the personalities and complications involved, the situation was fluid enough that no accommodation had been reached by Wednesday night. Fox News did not respond to requests for comment on the status of the discussions or on the investigation, which is being conducted by the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton  Garrison. Lawyers for Mr. Ailes did not respond to requests for comment. Mr. Ailes has denied the allegations of sexual harassment and more than a dozen Fox News staff members, including some top stars, have publicly supported him. The people briefed on the investigation, who would not speak for attribution because of the sensitivity of the investigation, stressed that it was narrowly focused on the allegations against Mr. Ailes, and not the broader climate at the network. But Mr. Ailess departure will have much wider implications. Given Fox Newss place as a central hub for conservative opinion     not to mention as a primary outlet for the Republican nominee for president, Donald J. Trump     the shape of its   operation goes beyond corporate intrigue at 21st Century Fox, and could have consequences for the national political dialogue. In the two weeks since Gretchen Carlson, a former Fox anchor, filed suit against Mr. Ailes, the Murdoch family, which runs 21st Century Fox, has made it clear that its decision to take the allegations seriously was in keeping with its desire to follow modern standards for office conduct, and that these needed to extend to Fox News, as well. The question in the   environment is to what extent the Murdochs decide to continue on with Mr. Ailess current management team. That, in turn, could determine the future approach and look of the network, which is the outlet of choice for   viewers seeking an alternative to the mainstream media. Speculation about who Mr. Ailess successor would be transfixed the media world on Wednesday, with focus on outsiders such as the CBS News president, David Rhodes, who had worked at Fox News for several years one of Mr. Ailess current lieutenants, like Bill Shine or Michael Clemente the New York Post chief executive Jesse Angelo or someone from conservative media like Christopher Ruddy, the founder and chief executive of Newsmax Media Inc. At least for the day, fears that some of Fox Newss   stars, like Bill OReilly, Sean Hannity and Greta Van Susteren, would exercise contract clauses to leave with Mr. Ailess loss of his chairmanship, appeared to abate. Network staff members were acutely focused on Megyn Kelly, who had hinted in recent months she wanted to leave the network. She was one of the women who told Paul, Weiss investigators that Mr. Ailes had acted improperly with her, one of the people briefed on the inquiry said Tuesday. Ms. Kelly maintained her silence on Wednesday. But as the end of Mr. Ailess chairmanship approached, it appeared to embolden other women to discuss their own experiences at the network. Several spoke with reporters on condition that they not be named. In interviews, several current and former Fox News employees said inappropriate comments about a womans appearance and her sex life were frequent in the newsroom. The newsroom has been on edge in the weeks since Ms. Carlson filed her suit, one person said. Everybody wants to talk about the drama but nobody wants to talk in the open, the person said. As of Wednesday evening, staff members had not received an email from 21st Century Fox, Fox News or Mr. Ailes informing them about the events that have transpired, the investigation or the future of the network. The swift pace of events at Fox News     only two weeks passed between Ms. Carlsons filing of her lawsuit and the negotiations to end Mr. Ailess leadership     were especially surprising for a network that has made its name by embracing politically incorrect themes, something in keeping with the brash personalities of both Mr. Ailes and the 21st Century Fox patriarch, Rupert Murdoch. Female hosts in skirts, sitting behind translucent desks that can highlight their legs, have always been a network trademark. To completely move away from that ethos would be to fundamentally change the network. And 21st Century Foxs leadership will have to be mindful of maintaining its special relationship with viewers that Mr. Ailes has so carefully cultivated, and which is central to the financial and ratings success of the network. Mr. Murdoch will ultimately determine that direction in close consultation     and perhaps even some deference     to the two sons he is grooming to succeed him, Lachlan and James Murdoch. The latter, at least, is known to have different politics from his father. So far, none of the three has made any public statement about the network, its future or, for that matter, Mr. Ailes.","label":0,"_deepnote_index_column":45},{"id":46,"title":"Press TV Debate: Duff on Lebanon, Hezbollah and Aouns Presidency (3 videos)","author":"Gordon Duff, Senior Editor","text":"By Gordon Duff, Senior Editor on November 2, 2016 Understanding Lebanon and the political realignment there critical to US understanding of the region...and to our future with Israel \nLebanon has a new president. The political development puts an end to over two years of power vacuum in the country. On Monday, lawmakers voted to pick General Michel Aoun as Lebanons 13th president. The election is seen as a victory for the resistance movement Hezbollah, especially after Saad Hariri, the leader of the March 14 Alliance and a close ally of Saudi Arabia, voiced his support for Aoun. On this edition of The Debate, Press TV has asked two analysts why they believe Hariri threw his weight behind Aoun. \nNabil Mikhail, a professor at The George Washington University, praised Hariris measure, adding that with this decision, he actually wanted to bring stability back to Lebanon and thus avoid Syrias spillover effects. \nHariri is a shrewd politician who represents an important segment of the Lebanese society, Mikhail said, adding that by his vote for General Aoun, he aimed to take the country out of the current political deadlock and, ultimately, save it from the repercussions of the Syrian war. \nMikhail believes that the United States shrinking power in the Middle East has forced Hariri to face away from Washington. \nI believe that Saad Hariri could have been motivated, along with others, about a vision that Americas role in the Middle East is receding. So, perhaps Russia is the new reality in the Middle East, is a new power. So, anything that is somehow close to Russia will be better for Lebanon, Mikhail argued. \nMikhail said that so many things have transpired inside Lebanon and inside the Arab region within this year. I would assume that the Syrian civil war and its severity and brutality has convinced him that he can maintain good ties with the [Persian] Gulf states but at the same time study the strategic realities. \nHe (Hariri) sees that Syria has to be stable in order for Lebanon to be stable. So, he is making calculations. I hope none of them is a miscalculation because the area cannot afford any other catastrophe. So, he displayed again very well maintaining some sort of balance between his Syrian interests and [Persian] Gulf interests and perhaps he can formulate some equilibrium about this. The image grab shows Gordon Duff (L), a senior editor of Veterans Today based in Ohio, and Nabil Mikhail, a professor at The George Washington University, at Press TVs The Debate show on Monday night. \nMeanwhile, the other guest on the show, Gordon Duff, the editor of Veterans Today , noted that, in his view, the reason behind Hezbollahs victory in Michel Aouns election is the movements victories in Syria, especially in Aleppo, which has made it more powerful than ever and has paved the way for domestic victories. \nIf Aleppo falls, and Aleppo will fall, its only a matter of how long, a victorious and highly-disciplined, highly-trained Hezbollah force, [which is] heavily trained by Russia and by Iran, is going to return to Lebanon. Its a very different force and I believe Hariri is looking at this. Reaching out for what should be a very different Hezbollah could lead to stabilization of the political process in Lebanon that has been out of control, Duff reiterated.

Chen","text":"SAN FRANCISCO     Dogged by combustible smartphones and recalls of other devices, Samsung Electronics is hoping to find a path to product redemption. The South Korean company on Wednesday introduced the Galaxy S8, its first major smartphone release since the scandal over its Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, which were discontinued last year after some of the devices spontaneously caught fire. Its been a challenging year for Samsung, said D. J. Koh, the companys head of mobile devices, adding that Samsung was ready to start anew. The Galaxy S8 features a large 5.  screen without adding bulk to the device. The company said it made room for the screen by reducing the size of the bezel     or the forehead and the chin     on the face of the device. Samsung also made the home button into a virtual button and shoved it under the display. With the Galaxy S8, Samsung also rolled out its virtual assistant, Bixby, to rival Apples Siri, Googles Assistant and Amazons Alexa. Similar to previous virtual assistants, Bixby responds to voice commands. Time     and sales     will tell whether the Galaxy S8 will restore confidence in Samsungs smartphones. Last year, after the company received dozens of complaints about the Galaxy Note 7 overheating, and in some cases exploding, the company recalled the phones. But replacement phones continued to catch fire, and the company had to recall the devices a second time before killing the product altogether, sacrificing billions of dollars in revenue. The Galaxy Note 7 may still make a reappearance. On Monday, Samsung said that it might sell refurbished versions of the phone. Jan Dawson, an independent analyst for Jackdaw Research, said the Galaxy S8 could help Samsung recover as long as the product worked reliably. Note 7 definitely did some damage to the Samsung brand, especially for people who had little or no personal experience with Samsung devices, he said. But as long as the S8 does well and doesnt suffer from any of the same problems, the memories of the Note 7 issues will fade and Samsung will recover well. Samsung last year also issued a separate recall for 2. 8 million washing machines in the United States. The machines were prone to detaching from the washing machine chassis, posing a risk of injury. The Galaxy S8 will arrive in stores next month with a starting price of $750.","label":0,"_deepnote_index_column":48},{"id":49,"title":"Poland Vows Referendum on Migrant Quota Amidst EU Pressure: The Publics Voice Will Be Heard - Breitbart","author":"Virginia Hale","text":"The publics voice will be heard, Polands president declared, as he vowed a referendum on the European Unions (EU) migrant quota amidst growing pressure from Brussels. [Describing the question of whether Poland should be forced to accept a quota of migrants from the third world as of vital importance for its future security, Andrzej Duda said the referendum could be held during parliamentary elections in 2019.  That would allow the new government to hear the clear voice of the nation on the issue, said the president. The conservative Law and Justice (PiS) governments position on the quota system is clear and unambiguous Duda said. He said maintaining the party does not agree with the [plan] and asserted that Poland does not consent to the forced relocation of refugees on our territory. Holding a referendum will also enable the publics voice to be heard over the voices of international organisations, Duda asserted. If Brussels continues to raise [the issue of migration] attempting to exert pressure and force on the Polish authorities, then public opinion will be extremely important, Duda promised. Polands latest display of opposition to the redistribution plan comes as the Czech Republic announced its withdrawal from the scheme, which has been fiercely contested in Central and Eastern Europe, with Hungary and Slovakia challenging the plans in court. In an interview with Czech tabloid Blesk published Tuesday, EU president   Juncker demanded all nations in Europe shoulder solidarity and responsibility when it comes to migration. Brussels was left humiliated last year when Hungarians were asked what they thought of EU plans to force on their nation migrants from the third world, as 95 per cent said they rejected the scheme. Earlier this month, Breitbart London reported that senior Polish MEP Ryszard Czarnecki announced the only proven method to avoid Islamist terror attacks is not to import Muslim migrants. When it comes to reducing the chances of Poland being hit by [Islamist] terror attacks, the only proven method is to not allow in Muslim migrants, the MEP told local radio after the London Bridge terror attack, which killed eight and injured at least 48 others.","label":0,"_deepnote_index_column":49},{"id":50,"title":"Sparking An Inner Revolution","author":"Lance Schuttler","text":"0 0 With humanitys awakening continuing to speed up as every day passes, we see more and more people desiring information to help them better themselves. Whether that is done through eating healthier foods, beginning a yoga or meditation practice, or whether it is done by being more mindful with the words they choose to use when having an inner dialogue or a conversation with friends and family, more people are looking for information to help them transform their lives in a positive way. While there are many methods to improving ones life, below are some methods that can help a person spark an inner revolution to create positive and uplifting change in his or her world. Grounding/Earthing Grounding, or what is also called Earthing is when a person has bare skin touching the Earth or a tree and is most commonly done by standing on the Earth with ones bare feet. Doing this begins to balance the electrochemical state of the body because of the negative ions the Earth emits. Negative ions act as antioxidants (free-radical scavengers) by pairing up with the free radicals and rendering them neutral. Thus, pain, inflammation and anything out of balance begins to move towards balance, or homeostasis. There have been several studies that have shown how grounding helps with pain reduction, wounding healing, balancing of the circadian rhythm to help improve sleep, as well as helping to shift a persons brainwaves to the alpha state, which is great for a calm and balanced, yet alert and fully awake state of mind. Standing barefoot on the Earth, sand, dirt or concrete (not asphalt) will allow the free flow of negative ions to come in contact with the sensory neurons on the skin and begin to trigger positive physiological and psychological changes within the body. Taking it a bit further, if a person is able to connect with the Earth in a quiet place, the benefits could be even more as Dr. Joe Dispenza has said , In clinical studies, we have proven that 2 hours of nature sounds a day significantly reduce stress hormones up to 800% and activates 500-600 DNA segments known to be responsible for healing and repairing the body. Burning Sage In a 2007 study from the Journal of Ethnopharmacology , researchers found that medicinal smoke killed harmful airborne bacteria by up to 94% in just one hour. On a more spiritual level, burning sage has long been used to clear negative or disharmonious energies from a space. This can be done when a person comes home from work or school for that day, as burning sage can be a good way to clear any discordant energy the person may have picked up or had taken on from other people or their environment. It is used to clear away such energy so that a person can be centered in who he or she is, rather than having to deal with issues that might have been taken on from others. I personally do this each time after coming home from getting groceries or running and errand. Essential Oils The two best ways to use essential oils are to smell them as well as apply them to the skin. While applying essential oils to the skin has many of its own benefits, smelling them also creates wonderful responses in the body, and especially the brain. According to the University of Minnesota , smelling essential oils molecules affect the olfactory organs, the lungs (and thus the respiratory system) as well as the brain. Odor molecules travel through the nose and positively affect the limbic system of the brain, which is sometimes called the emotional part of the brain. To this end, the limbic system controls heart rate, mood, blood pressure, memory, breathing, stress hormone response and overall stress levels. Applying or smelling essential oils throughout the day is a wonderful way to develop emotional intelligence and can help a person respond to stressful situations in a more positive way than before. Smelling essential oils can be personally described as an uplifting and heavenly experience; one that allows us to smell the cosmic byproduct of thousands of flowers pressed into a wonderful gift for humanity. Breathing Exercises Breathing exercises, which can also be considered a form of meditation, can have profound effects on the body and mind. According to Deepok Chopra , a regular practice of rhythmic deep breathing has been shown to reduce anxiety and depression, stabilize blood pressure, increase energy levels and decrease feelings of stress. Over time, a breathing or meditation practice can lead to wonderful internal shifts both physically and emotionally. Incorporating a deep breathing practice into the practice of grounding or Earthing is a great way to accomplish both practices at once. Here is an article of three sample breathing exercises from Dr. Andrew Weil. While there are many other practices a person can use to help catalyze deeper inner growth, such as flower essence therapy (different from essential oils), nature walking, sun-bathing and the use of certain health supplements like fulvic acid and Reishi , this list is a guide that may help those who may just be starting to experience an internal transformation. These four simple practices can be easy to incorporate into ones life and is recommended to experiment with what feels best for that person. What of these practices do you use in your life? What other practices do you use to help you continue your inner revolution? Share with us your practices or suggestions you have in the comments section. Cheers to our health!

In Montenegro, which split from Serbia a decade ago, NATO is on Friday due to wrap up a five-day disaster-relief drill of 680 unarmed personnel from seven NATO members and 10 partner countries including Serbia. \"It is in the interest of Montenegro, in the interest of NATO, and also in the interest of the region, to be part of NATO and promote Euro-Atlantic values in the Balkans, and these values benefit each and every one of us,\" Montenegro's deputy Prime Minister Dusko Markovic , said about the exercise. Across the border, in Serbia, Russia flew in its paratroopers along with allied Belarus for an exercise called \"Slavic Brotherhood\", which according the Serbian defence ministry focuses on \"fighting terrorism\". \nThe drills are set to last until November 9 and will include 212 Russian, 450 Serbian and 56 Belarusian troops. Three Russian transport planes have already landed in Belgrade on Wednesday bringing in soldiers and equipment. \nDrills in the two former Yugoslav republics reflect mounting tensions between Russia and the West over a variety of geopolitical issues including conflicts in Syria and Ukraine. \nREAD MORE: RUSSIA IS MOVING NUKES WEST IN RESPONSE TO CONTINUING NATO AGGRESSION \nIn Serbia, NATO is hugely unpopular after its 1999 bombing ousted Belgrade's armed forces out of its former southern province of Kosovo. \nBut as part of its integrations with the West, Serbia last year signed the Individual Partnership Action Plan (IPAP), the highest level of cooperation between NATO and a country not aspiring to join. \nAn EU candidate, Serbia insists that it is militarily neutral, but maintains close ties with Russia, its Orthodox Christian and Slavic superpower ally, the biggest gas and oil source and an obstacle to Kosovo's membership in the United Nations. \nLast year Montenegro accepted an invitation to join NATO, a move that soured relations withRussia.

[Apparently, being in sole control of one of the   aluminum shells hurtling at high speed on Americas roads isnt enough to hold drivers attention. Traffic deaths have jumped by 14% since 2014, according to Cambridge Mobile Telematics, which conducted the study. The research firm found that 52% of accidents involved drivers who were distracted by their phones.    phone use while driving laws have done little to curb the habits of its citizens. Only fourteen states have banned handheld use of phones while driving, and only twenty prohibit phone use by school bus drivers a single state bans bus drivers from texting. But Cambridge Mobile Telematics Chief Technology Officer, Hari Balakrishnan, has hope: Distracted driving due to smartphone use is intuitively blamed for the increase in road crashes and claims. Whats less intuitive is that smartphones hold the solution to the problem they created. Drivers now have access to tools that analyze their driving and achieve real behavioral change through immediate and ongoing feedback. Balakrishnan called distracted driving one of the most urgent public safety problems facing our communities today and stressed the importance of taking a critical look at how we can most effectively reduce the danger that drivers face.  CMT is working to do their part. Their DriveWell app both monitors drivers and encourages safer driving habits. The site claims that users see an average reduction of 35% in phone distraction, 20% in hard braking, and 20% in   speeding all within less than 30 days of using the program.  Their goals are best summed up by Balakrishnan himself: By harnessing the very technology that threatens driver safety, and using it to help drivers understand and improve their behavior, were making the world safer by the day.

It will have little to do with politics and more to do with a much bigger picture. As everyone knows, many people are celebrating the Trump victory and many people are mourning it. What is needed right now is a wider perspective at what is occurring. Donald Trump will become the next U.S. President. \nWith Donald Trump set to take over the Oval Office in late January of 2017, there are many unknowns, just as it would be if Hillary would have won. \nWhat is going to happen with health insurance? What is going to happen with immigration laws? What is going to happen with foreign policy in relation to other nations? More importantly, what is going to happen to us as individuals and humanity as a whole? \nIndividual Healing \nWhile these questions need to be asked and will in time be answered, we must remember that we cannot give up our personal power to shape our individual lives. Right now, many people are worried and many people are thrilled. Regardless of our feelings on this election, we must remember that we alone are responsible for our individual lives as we make countless choices each day. How will I choose to treat others today? How will I choose to treat myself today? Am I taking care of my physical body well by eating well and exercising enough? Am I ensuring to get enough sleep throughout the week? What is it I can do today to become a better person? By either believing that one person is going to save or change your entire life or by believing that one person is going to ruin your entire life gives away your own personal power. The great philosopher Epictetus once said , It is not what happens to you, it is how you respond. We always have a choice in our response to any situation. \nBy either being saddened or thrilled at the perception that one man is going to either ruin or save your life is extremely dis-empowering. Though each person has every right to feel how they want, it must be remembered where true power comes from: within . Every person has the choice how they wish to respond to this election. Are you going to wither away in frustration, anger and despair or are you going to make choices that help you to become the best person you can be? On the opposite side, are you going to sit back and believe your personal challenges are going to be fixed with a new president or are you also going to take action to become the best person you can be? Regardless of who you did or didnt support, we all need to reclaim our personal power and continue the trek towards bettering and healing ourselves, even if it is in the smallest of ways. \nCollective Healing \nOn a wider scale, this election will give us the collective choice to where we wish to travel. Do we wish to seek peace with other people and other countries? Do we wish to have dialogue with nations previous administrations demonized? Do we wish to communicate with and try to understand other peoples viewpoints or are we going to remain closed off to such opportunities for personal and collective healing and growth? \nAdditionally, are we going to continue to allow group-think to dominate our society by letting the media tell us what to believe, or are we going to begin gathering information from several sources to arrive at our own conclusions? Are we going to question our leaders more and demand answers that are truthful and unbiased towards any specific agenda? Will we do this both on a local and mass level? Are we going to work towards cooperation or continue to live in a dying paradigm of competition? \nAs physicist and author Gregg Braden says , A growing body of scientific evidence, gathered from more than 400 peer-reviewed studies, is leading to an undeniable truth: violent competition and war directly contradict our deepest instincts of cooperation and nurturing. Scientific studies show conclusively that nature is based upon a model of cooperation and mutual aid, not violent competition and war. We live in a world where everything is connected. We can no longer think in terms of us and them when it comes to the consequences of the way we live. Today its all about WE . Science has disproved Darwins theory and shows us we must act in unison to transcend our collective challenges. \nI see this election as many other do: a massive turning point in our worlds evolution. I personally have full trust that we will look back at this time and see this as a positive, yet challenging event in that it empowered more people to begin taking action to create the kind of world they wish to live in. This turning point is allowing us all to shift our perception of the world and to initiate action towards creating a more peaceful, happy and abundant world for all. \nLance Schuttler graduated from the University of Iowa with a degree in Health Science and practices health coaching through his website Orgonlight Health .

Islam","text":"1 Shares\n1 0 0 0\nBook Review  Dr. Rafiq Islam, Emertec R&D Ltd; Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia\n Book title: True Islam, Jihad, and Terrorism: The Science of Islamic Foreign Policy  Jaan S. Islam\n Publisher: New York: Nova Science Publishers\n ISBN 978-1-63485-542-6.\n At a time of politics of fear, Jaan Islam counters fear with knowledge in his masterpiece, True Islam, Jihad and Terrorism (Nova Science Publishers, New York, 2016). During the 2016 US election, it has become clear world peace and security is connected to the state of Islam and how it is understood in todays context. This is a very timely book that fills a gap in the western society about Islamic history, philosophy, and political science. This book presents the Islamic political philosophy as represented in the writings of great Muslim thinkers and scholars such as Ibn Khaldun. Jaan Islam uses the so-called Islamic cognition technique and starts the book with a chapter dedicated to Islamic cognition. This chapter on cognition itself is a paradigm shift in the modern research scholarship and can be considered for advancing knowledge in other fields. Such an extension was first pointed by Islam, Zatzman and Islam (2013) in their ground-breaking work on educational curriculum.\nMORE... Stop using millenary religions as a scapegoat for the crimes of Modern Imperialism Another Ramadan for Muslims amid sufferings A conversation on equality, integration and Islam as a religious marker An open letter to young Muslims everywhere: The seed of triumph in every adversity Following the tradition of early Islamic scholars, Jaan Islam presented all theories in the book with evidence from the primary Islamic sources, Qur'an and authenticated traditions of the prophet . These sources were completely ignored in the in the Orientalist (now it has morphed into neo-Orientalism) writings, which led to the inundation of the post 9/11 world with disinformation and agenda-driven research about Islamic history. The distinction between this book and these agenda-driven ones gives the book a special value.\n Although the book explains the Islamic foundations of political science and governance, it should not be looked at as a book of theology. It is a dogma-free approach that has been characterized as truly scientific elsewhere . Quite appropriately, the author starts off with a brilliant narration of Islamic cognition. It has been all but forgotten in the west that Islam is the religion that started the tradition of dogma-free, truly scientific cognition. The west does recognize Averres, the famous Islamic scholar as the father of secular philosophy, whereas brands Islam as just another religion, similar to Christianity, infected with doctrinal philosophy. It is no surprise that with that starting point, Islam remains the most misunderstood religion in the west.\nChapter 3 of the book deals with fundamental philosophies of three major philosophers, namely Hobbes, Locke and Ibn Khaldun. In this chapter, the author debunks another myth, that is Ibn Khalduns political theory is somehow similar to those of Hobbes and Locke. Ibn Khaldun, the father of social science, indeed had a very different starting point in his cognition. The author points out how Ibn Khalduns first premise was Shahadah that formed the basis of the cognition axis by using Quran as the origin and prophet Muhammads life (through the book of Hadith) as the pivotal point. One the other hand, Locke had placed himself as the pivotal point, whereas Hobbes eliminated any cognition point. The author makes it clear that both Hobbes and Lockes cognition tools are just as illogical as dogmatic cognition. In my researched opinion, this accurate distinction has not been made by any other author on the topic. It is because the eastern authors do not know about Hobbes and Locke and the western authors do not know about Islamic cognition that was obviously alive and well with Ibn Khaldun.\nIn Chapter 4, the author uses the case laws of the prophet and his four rightly guided caliphs (known as Rashedun Caliphs). Clearly, the authors intention is to understand how the prophet and his closest followers went to war or which verses of the Quran they were enacting. For the first time anyone took this approach and not surprisingly, the author comes up with four rigid criteria from the Quran. No other author to the best of my knowledge connected them to specific wars that the prophet and his companions engaged in. This finding helps the author establish jus ad bellum that can explain every war that shaped the foundation of the young Islamic state of the time.\nSimilar to Chapter 4, the author discovers jus ad bello in Islamic jurisprudence in Chapter 5. Once again, the case laws are presented and analyzed in such a manner, one can take any new example and evaluate it to call it permissible or not. The theoretical basis for critiquing any modern warfare is set in this chapter.\nIn Chapter 6, the author addresses a difficult topic. When is it allowed or even mandatory to rebel against a head of state? It is often stated that Islam is a complete code of life. The author makes it clear that Islam didnt leave anything to imagination and has left a strict criterion and modus operandi for any imaginable crisis that can occur at any time. The important question arises as to when a head of state that once claimed to have divine authority can be removed or when a head of state can be declared unfit and it becomes mandatory for the citizens to remove him or wage war if necessary. This is not an easy topic to cover even in todays world. The author covers it with dexterity from an epoch he considers as exemplary. The history is not pretty and there is room for controversy as often the history is written by the victor and clearly after the demise of the rightly guided Caliphate, the victors were no longer rightly guided. The author weaves through this difficult process and makes it clear for the readership. This chapter can be an eye opener even for a student of Islam that has spent lifetime on the topic.\nOften when Islamic criteria are discussed, eyes roll and eye brows furrow in disbelief. If it is all that simple, why dont Islamic scholars have consensus? The author handles this topic like a pro. In Chapter 7, he analyzes current Islamic scholars and deconstructs their thought process. He has kind words for some but has nothing but scorn for the self-righteous, apologist scholars that have done great disservice to Islam and/or scientific cognition process. One doesnt have to be personal, but the writing is so clear, one can hardly afford to not get angry at certain genre of scholars. To anyones surprise, this list is not made out of anti-Islamic non-Muslim scholars.\nChapter 8 is where proof of the pudding appears. The author analyzes every major event of todays political arena and analyzes it with the Islamic criteria of both jus ad bello and jus ad bellum. The author comes up with an index to rank various countries and groups. Most interesting is the discussion on current US allies, such as Saudi Arabia, and how they rank among the biggest offenders of Islam and Islamic laws. This is not a topic for the faint of heart but the author did an excellent job making it easily readable, punctuated with numerous riveting arguments.\nChapter 9 is the conclusion and recommendation. I have studied Islam for some 30 years and yet I found these conclusions novel and entirely logical. I doubt anyone would agree with the conclusions unless of course that person reads the entire book prior to reading the conclusion. It is important to read the book in sequence.\nChapter 10 lists the bibliography and references. It is many pages long and is quite comprehensive.\nChapter 11 is the Appendix that lists the letters of the prophet. It is a great idea to give the letters in original Arabic, so there is no room for misinterpretation, let alone disinformation.\nAnyone with knowledge of Islam knows that Jihad is in the core of Islam and this book shows it is so and there needs to be no apology. Quite interestingly, the author even depicts Jihad as the roof of Islam. Without the roof, the Fort of Islam has no protection whatsoever.

Before I go any further, I want to make it exceedingly clear that I am not saying what the outcome will be on November 8th. As I recently told a national television audience, I do not know who is going to win. \nIn this article I am simply going to examine the poll numbers and the electoral map as they currently stand. But in this bizarre election things can literally change overnight, and it is entirely possible that we could still have another October surprise or two before it is all said and done. And without a doubt Donald Trump desperately needs something to move the needle, because if the election was held today Hillary Clinton would almost certainly win. \nWhat we have witnessed so far during the 2016 election season has been absolutely unprecedented. Just consider some of the things that we have seen up to this point in time. \nWe have never had a bigger October surprise than the release of the lewd audio tape from 11 years ago in which Donald Trump claimed to grope women without their consent. \nWe have never seen the mainstream media openly attack a presidential candidate as much as they have attacked Donald Trump. In the past, the big mainstream news outlets at least pretended to be fair and balanced, but this year they have completely discarded all notions of objectivity. \nThey should be completely and utterly ashamed of themselves, and no matter who wins the election they will never be able to get their integrity back. \nWe have also never seen a major party at war with itself this close to a presidential election. It has been said that a house divided against itself will surely fall, and a whole host of prominent Republican leaders have been openly attempting to sabotage the Trump campaign. \nIf Donald Trump is able to overcome all of these factors, it truly will be a miracle of Biblical proportions. \nAs it stands at the moment, however, the numbers are looking quite ominous for Trump. Right now, the Real Clear Politics average of national polls has Hillary Clinton ahead by 6.2 percent. Most political experts consider that to be an insurmountable lead at this stage in the game. \nBut even if Trump can close that gap and pull ahead, that does not mean that he will win the election. In fact, Trump could beat Clinton by millions of votes nationally and still lose. \nIn order to win the election, one candidate has got to get to 270 electoral votes. And on the latest Real Clear Politics electoral map, 262 electoral votes are being projected to go to Hillary Clinton, 164 electoral votes are being projected to go to Donald Trump, and 112 electoral votes are in the toss up category. \nSo unless something dramatically changes, Donald Trump is essentially going to have to run the table in all of the closely contested states in order to win, and the mathematical odds of that happening are extremely slim. \nLets take a closer look at this. The first thing that Donald Trump is going to have to do in order to get to 270 electoral votes is to win all of the states that Mitt Romney won in 2012. That would get him up to 206 electoral votes. \nUnfortunately, it looks like that may be very difficult to do. Romney won North Carolina, but the six most recent polls all have Clinton ahead in that state. Romney also won Arizona, but the most recent poll to be taken there has Clinton ahead by five points. \nBut for a moment, lets assume that Trump can win all of the states that Romney won. On top of that, there are four other states that Trump must win \n#1 Trump must win Floridas 29 electoral votes. Without Florida, Trump has no realistic path to 270 electoral votes. So on election night if it is announced that Trump has lost Florida, you might as well turn off your television and go to bed because Trump is going to lose the election. \nUnfortunately for Trump, four recent major surveys all show Trump down by four points in the Sunshine state. \n#2 Trump must win Ohios 18 electoral votes. No Republican has ever won the presidency without winning Ohio, and the two most recent major surveys show that Trump and Clinton are tied in the state. \n#3 Trump must win Iowas 6 electoral votes. Fortunately for Trump, most recent surveys show him actually leading in Iowa. \n#4 Trump must win Nevadas 6 electoral votes. At this point that is looking like it will be very tough to do, because all of the recent polls have Clinton leading in Nevada, including the most recent one that has her up by 7 points. \nIf Donald Trump can win those four states, that still does not get him to 270 electoral votes. Instead, it gets him to 265 electoral votes, and so he would still need one more medium-sized state to win. \nThe most likely candidates for that last state are Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin or Minnesota. Unfortunately for Trump, Clinton appears to have big leads in all four of those states right at this moment. \nBut even if Trump can somehow pull off a miracle and squeak past the 270 electoral vote mark, the truth is that Utah could still mess everything up. \nDo you remember Evan McMullin? \nHe was the third party conservative alternative candidate that was hyped for a couple of days but that seemingly fell off the map afterwards. \nHe is only on the ballot in 12 states, but one of those states is Utah, and it turns out that Evan McMullin is a Mormon. \nMany Mormons believe that a Mormon will be elected president someday when the U.S. Constitution hangs like a thread. According to this belief, this Mormon president will turn the country around and all sorts of wonderful things will start to happen. Many Mormons thought that Mitt Romney was going to be this president, but now Evan McMullin has become the target of these expectations. \nSo how in the world could Evan McMullin become president? \nWell, their plan is to have Evan McMullin win Utah, and that could potentially keep both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton from both getting to 270 electoral votes if the election is super close. If that happens, the election would be thrown into the House of Representatives. \nIt is being projected that the House will still be controlled by the Republicans after this election, and so the choice would come down to either Trump or McMullin, and those backing McMullin believe that he would have a realistic shot in that scenario. \nI know all of this sounds very strange, but this is actually being discussed around family dinner tables all over Utah tonight. \nAnd in recent days Evan McMullin has been soaring in Utah. One recent survey shows Trump with a one point lead over McMullin, and another recent survey actually show McMullin leading Trump by four points in the state. \nSo Trump could pull off a miracle and do everything else that he needs to do to get to 270 electoral votes, and Utah could end up messing up everything for him. \nIn addition, it is also very important to keep in mind that Trump could actually get all of the legitimate votes that he needs to win and still have it stolen from him by election fraud. There was widespread evidence of funny business in 2012, and this is something that I detailed for a live studio audience down at Morningsideearlier this month \nAre you starting to see why I would consider this to be the biggest miracle in American political history if Donald Trump actually overcomes all of these factors and wins the election? \nAnd we dont have to wait until November 8th to get some indications about how the vote is going to go. Early voting is already taking place is some states, and so far the signs are not encouraging for the Trump campaign. The following comes from CNN \nDemocratic early turnout has stayed steady in North Carolina compared to 2012, while Republicans have dropped by about 14,500. In Nevada, Democrats have a smaller early voting deficit today than they did at this point in 2012. And Democrats are slightly ahead in Arizona in the early vote so far, though they are lagging Republicans in the tally of how many Arizonans have requested ballots. \nPerhaps most surprisingly, Democrats improved their position in conservative and Mormon-heavy Utah, where recent polls have shown a tight race. At this point in 2012, Republicans led Democrats in early voting by more than 22,000 voters. But so far this year, the GOP advantage is only 3,509. \nBut if you do want Trump to win, the good news is that we still have more than two weeks before November 8th. \nWe have seen some extremely bizarre things happen already in this election, and a miracle is definitely not out of the question. \nIn fact, I am of the opinion that it is quite likely that some very strange events could take place between now and early November. So hold on to your hats, because the most interesting portion of the 2016 election may still be ahead of us.","label":1,"_deepnote_index_column":58},{"id":59,"title":"Mindful Eating as Way to Fight Bingeing - The New York Times","author":"Jeff Gordinier","text":"Editors note: Were resurfacing this 2012 article for Smarter Living. Now sit down, take a deep breath and really savor that Christmas cookie. TRY this: place a forkful of food in your mouth. It doesnt matter what the food is, but make it something you love     lets say its that first nibble from three hot, fragrant, perfectly cooked ravioli. Now comes the hard part. Put the fork down. This could be a lot more challenging than you imagine, because that first bite was very good and another immediately beckons. Youre hungry. Todays experiment in eating, however, involves becoming aware of that reflexive urge to plow through your meal like Cookie Monster on a shortbread bender. Resist it. Leave the fork on the table. Chew slowly. Stop talking. Tune in to the texture of the pasta, the flavor of the cheese, the bright color of the sauce in the bowl, the aroma of the rising steam. Continue this way throughout the course of a meal, and youll experience the    pleasures and frustrations of a practice known as mindful eating. The concept has roots in Buddhist teachings. Just as there are forms of meditation that involve sitting, breathing, standing and walking, many Buddhist teachers encourage their students to meditate with food, expanding consciousness by paying close attention to the sensation and purpose of each morsel. In one common exercise, a student is given three raisins, or a tangerine, to spend 10 or 20 minutes gazing at, musing on, holding and patiently masticating. Lately, though, such experiments of the mouth and mind have begun to seep into a secular arena, from the Harvard School of Public Health to the California campus of Google. In the eyes of some experts, what seems like the simplest of acts     eating slowly and genuinely relishing each bite     could be the remedy for a   Paula Deen Nation in which an endless parade of new diets never seems to slow a stampede toward obesity. Mindful eating is not a diet, or about giving up anything at all. Its about experiencing food more intensely     especially the pleasure of it. You can eat a cheeseburger mindfully, if you wish. You might enjoy it a lot more. Or you might decide, halfway through, that your body has had enough. Or that it really needs some salad. This is  said Dr. Jan Chozen Bays, a pediatrician and meditation teacher in Oregon and the author of Mindful Eating: A Guide to Rediscovering a Healthy and Joyful Relationship with Food.  I think the fundamental problem is that we go unconscious when we eat.  The last few years have brought a spate of books, blogs and videos about   eating. A Harvard nutritionist, Dr. Lilian Cheung, has devoted herself to studying its benefits, and is passionately encouraging corporations and health care providers to try it. At the Food and Brand Lab at Cornell University, Prof. Brian Wansink, the author of Mindless Eating: Why We Eat More Than We Think, has conducted scores of experiments on the psychological factors that lead to our bottomless bingeing. A mindful lunch hour recently became part of the schedule at Google, and   gurus like Oprah Winfrey and Kathy Freston have become cheerleaders for the practice. With the annual   of Thanksgiving, Christmas and Super Bowl Sunday behind us, and Lent coming, its worth pondering whether mindful eating is something that the mainstream ought to be, well, more mindful of. Could a discipline pioneered by Buddhist monks and nuns help teach us how to get healthy, relieve stress and shed many of the neuroses that weve come to associate with food? Dr. Cheung is convinced that it can. Last week, she met with team members at Harvard Pilgrim Health Care and asked them to spend quality time with a   almond. The rhythm of life is becoming faster and faster, so we really dont have the same awareness and the same ability to check into ourselves, said Dr. Cheung, who, with the Vietnamese Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh,   Savor: Mindful Eating, Mindful Life.  Thats why mindful eating is becoming more important. We need to be coming back to ourselves and saying: Does my body need this? Why am I eating this? Is it just because Im so sad and stressed out?  The topic has even found its way into culinary circles that tend to be more focused on Rabelaisian excess than monastic restraint. In January, Dr. Michael Finkelstein, a holistic physician who oversees SunRaven, a   center in Bedford, N. Y. gave a talk about mindful gardening and eating at the   headquarters of the James Beard Foundation in New York City. The question isnt what are the foods to eat, in my mind, he said in an interview. Most people have a general sense of what the healthy foods are, but theyre not eating them. Whats on your mind when youre eating: thats mindful eating to me.  A good place to try it is the Blue Cliff Monastery, in Pine Bush, N. Y. a Hudson Valley hamlet. At the serene refuge about 75 miles northwest of Manhattan, curious lay people can join Buddhist brothers and sisters for a free day of mindfulness twice a week. At a gathering in January, visitors watched a videotaped lecture by Thich Nhat Hanh (pronounced   ) who founded this and other monasteries around the world they strolled methodically around the grounds as part of a walking meditation, then filed into a dining room for lunch. No one spoke, in keeping with a key principle of mindful eating. The point is simply to eat, as opposed to eating and talking, eating and watching TV, or eating and watching TV and gossiping on the phone while Tweeting and updating ones Facebook status. A long buffet table of food awaited, all of it vegan and mindfully prepared by two monks in the kitchen. There was plenty of rice, herbed chickpeas, a soup made with cubes of taro, a stew of fried tofu in tomato sauce. In silence, people piled their plates with food, added a squirt or two of condiments (eating mindfully doesnt mean forsaking the hot sauce) and sat down together with eyes closed during a Buddhist prayer for gratitude and moderation. What followed was captivating and mysterious. Surrounded by a murmur of clinking forks, spoons and chopsticks, the Blue Cliff congregation, or sangha, spent the lunch hour contemplating the enjoyment of spice, crunch, saltiness, warmth, tenderness and   company. Some were thinking, too, about the origins of the food: the thousands of farmers, truck drivers and laborers whose work had brought it here. As their jaws moved slowly, their faces took on expressions of deep focus. Every now and then came a pause within the pause: A chime would sound, and, according to the monasterys custom, all would stop moving and chewing in order to breathe and explore an even deeper level of sensory awareness. It looked peaceful, but inside some of those heads, a struggle was afoot. Its much more challenging than we would imagine, said Carolyn Cronin, 64, who lives near the monastery and regularly attends the mindfulness days. People are used to eating so fast. This is a practice of stopping, and we dont realize how much were not stopping.  For many people, eating fast means eating more. Mindful eating is meant to nudge us beyond what were craving so that we wake up to why were craving it and what factors might be stoking the habit of  . As we practice this regularly, we become aware that we dont need to eat as much, said Phap Khoi, 43, a robed monk who has been stationed at Blue Cliff since it opened in 2007. Whereas when people just gulp down food, they can eat a lot and not feel full.  Its this byproduct of mindful eating     its potential as a psychological barrier to overeating     that has generated excitement among nutritionists like Dr. Cheung. Thich Nhat Hanh often talks about our craving being like a crying baby who is trying to draw our attention, she said. When the baby cries, the mother cradles the baby to try to calm the baby right away. By acknowledging and embracing our cravings through a few breaths, we can stop our autopilot of reaching out to the pint of ice cream or the bag of chips.  The average American doesnt have the luxury of ruminating on the intense tang of sriracha sauce at a monastery. Most of us are not going to be Buddhist monks, said Dr. Finkelstein, the holistic physician. What Ive learned is that it has to work at home.  To that end, he and others suggest that people start with a few baby steps. Dont be too hard on yourself, Dr. Cheung said. Youre not supposed to be able to switch on your mindfulness button and be able to do it 100 percent. Its a practice you keep working toward.  Dr. Bays, the pediatrician, has recommendations that can sound like a return to the simple rhythms of Mayberry, if not Little House on the Prairie.  If its impossible to eat mindfully every day, consider planning one special repast a week. Click off the TV. Sit at the table with loved ones. How about the first five minutes we eat, we just eat in silence and really enjoy our food? she said. It happens step by step.  Sometimes, even she is too busy to contemplate a chickpea. So there are days when Dr. Bays will take three mindful sips of tea, and then, O. K. Ive got to go do my work, she said. Anybody can do that. Anywhere.  Even scarfing down a burrito in the car offers an opportunity for insight. Mindful eating includes mindless eating, she said.  I am aware that I am eating and driving.  Few places in America are as frantically abuzz with activity as the Google headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. but when Thich Nhat Hanh dropped by for a day of mindfulness in September, hundreds of employees showed up. Part of the event was devoted to eating thoughtfully in silence, and the practice was so well received that an hourlong wordless vegan lunch is now a monthly observance on the Google campus. Interestingly enough, a lot of the participants are the engineers, which pleases us very much, said Olivia Wu, an executive chef at the company. I think it quiets the mind. I think there is a real sense of feeling restored so that they can go back to the crazy pace that they came from.  Its not often, after all, that those workhorse technicians get to stop and smell the pesto. Somebody will say, I ate so much less,  Ms. Wu said. And someone else will say, You know, I never noticed how spicy arugula tastes.  And that could be the ingredient that helps mindful eating gain traction in mainstream American culture: flavor. So many people now have found themselves in an adversarial relationship with food, which is very tragic, Dr. Bays said. Eating should be a pleasurable activity. ","label":0,"_deepnote_index_column":59},{"id":60,"title":"The Major Potential Impact of a Corporate Tax Overhaul - The New York Times","author":"Neil Irwin","text":"The United States system for taxing businesses is a mess. If theres one thing nearly everyone can agree upon, it is that. The current corporate income tax manages the weird trick of both taxing companies at a higher statutory rate than other advanced countries while collecting less money, as a percentage of the overall economy, than most of them. It is infinitely complicated and it gives companies incentives to borrow too much money and move operations to countries with lower tax rates. Now, the moment for trying to fix all of that appears to have arrived. With the House, Senate and presidency all soon to be in Republican hands and with all agreeing that a major tax bill is a top priority, some kind of change appears likely to happen. And it may turn out to be a very big deal, particularly if a tax plan that House Republicans proposed last summer becomes the core of new legislation. Among Washingtons lobbying shops and policy analysis crowd, its known as a   cash flow tax with border adjustment.  Its easier to think of it as the most substantial reworking of how businesses are taxed since the corporate income tax was introduced a century ago. And it could, if enacted, have big effects not just in the tax departments of major corporations but in global financial markets and the aisles of your local Walmart. This possible revamping of the corporate tax code is less politically polarizing than the debates sure to unfold in the months ahead over health care, or even over individual income taxes. But the consequences for business     and for the   trajectory of the economy     are huge. The basic idea behind a D. B. C. F. T. (to use the abbreviation that has taken hold in a particularly nerdy corner of Twitter) is this: Right now companies are taxed based on their income generated in the United States. But there are countless tricks that corporate accountants can play to reduce the income companies report and to reduce their tax burden, and those tricks distort the economy. Two prime examples are transferring intellectual property to overseas holding companies and engaging in corporate inversions that move a companys legal headquarters to a country with lower taxes. Moreover, because interest payments on debt are   the current system makes it appealing to take on as much debt as possible, even though that can increase the risk of bankruptcy when a downturn comes along. The House Republicans approach, instead of taxing the    corporate income, goes after a firms domestic cash flow: money that comes in from sales within the United States borders minus money that goes out to pay employees and buy supplies and so forth. Theres no incentive to play games with overseas companies that exist only to exploit tax differences or to relocate production to countries with lower taxes because youll be taxed on things you sell in the United States, regardless. With an income tax, one of the key issues is how do you measure income,  said Alan Auerbach, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, who is a leading advocate of the idea. But with cash flow you just follow the money.  And the tax, Mr. Auerbach argues, could spur business investment while not encouraging companies to rely on debt. It allows companies to enjoy the tax savings of capital investments immediately rather than depreciating them over time. And it doesnt give favorable treatment to debt, as opposed to equity. That alone would amount to a major shift in the tax system. Congressional staff members, the incoming administration and armies of lobbyists will spend countless hours hammering out the details of any such proposal: how it might be phased in, and how to treat financial services, and much more. Some of the most complex, and politically problematic, elements of the plan revolve around its treatment of international trade, which creates winners and losers. And some of those potential losers are powerful. Consider what border adjustment means: When an American company exports goods under this new tax system, it would not pay any taxes on its international sales, while its imports would be taxed. So a company that spent $80 making something that it sold overseas for $100 would pay no tax on its earnings. A company that imported goods worth $80 from abroad and them sold them domestically for $100 would pay tax on the full $100. At first glance this looks as if it would boost exports and reduce the trade deficit. Indeed, it might prove politically promising for advocates of the strategy to pitch the plan as one that would do this. Many economists think it wont work that way, however. Thats because as soon as a    tax with border adjustment looks likely to become law, the value of the dollar should rise in currency markets. And that stronger dollar could eliminate the apparent     effects of the tax. The dollar could rise by, say, 20 to 25 percent, and the trade balance could remain about where it started. Essentially, moving to this system means betting on a textbook economic theory, as analysts at Evercore ISI put it, becoming a reality even though the effect hasnt been tested in practice. If the dollar doesnt strengthen as expected, for example,   industries, especially those with lean profit margins, could face disaster. That helps explain why some of the stiffest opposition to this tax overhaul is coming from the retail industry. Essentially, economists are telling them trust us, our models say the currency will adjust and it will all come out in the wash, but if the models are wrong, for companies like Walmart, Target and many others that sell large volumes of imported goods, their viability could be threatened. If the models turn out to be right, there is a different set of risks. The United States dollar is the linchpin of the global financial system, and a large move in its value triggered by changes in domestic tax policy could have unforeseen effects. Many companies worldwide, especially banks and especially in emerging markets, have debt denominated in dollars, which would become more of a burden after a new dollar appreciation. A big dollar rise would also effectively shift trillions in wealth from American investments overseas toward global investors with assets in the United States. As Jared Bernstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has noted, we dont really know what the distributional consequences of this tax overhaul would be. It could increase the costs of imported goods that the poor spend a disproportionate portion of their income on, like clothing and gasoline. That would be bad news for poorer Americans even as it makes the overall economy more efficient. Theres still a lot of work to be done to understand the   consequences of the D. B. C. F. T. (also, work to be done to find a catchier name). But theres a broader point about the nature of any major policy reform. The benefits of a reworked corporate tax code would emerge slowly these disruptions and costs could arrive almost instantly. No matter the outcome, 2017 will be a fascinating year in which core components of the tax system     with   economic consequences     will be up for grabs.","label":0,"_deepnote_index_column":60},{"id":61,"title":"I wonder what GLP will be like the day after the election?","author":"Anonymous Coward (UID 12781064)","text":"I wonder what GLP will be like the day after the election?

Molecular machines, the worlds smallest mechanical devices, may eventually be used to create new materials, sensors and energy storage systems, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said in announcing the prize. In terms of development, the molecular motor is at the same stage as the electric motor was in the 1830s, when scientists displayed various spinning cranks and wheels, unaware that they would lead to electric trains, washing machines, fans and food processors, the academy said. The three scientists       Sauvage, J. Fraser Stoddart and Bernard L. Feringa     will share equally in the prize of 8 million Swedish kronor, or about $930, 000. Nanotechnology     the creation of structures on the scale of a nanometer, or a billionth of a meter     has been a field of fruitful research for a couple of decades. Now, scientists are learning how to construct tiny moving machines about   the width of a strand of human hair. Theyve got it started, said Donna J. Nelson, a professor of chemistry at the University of Oklahoma and president of the American Chemical Society. This is just the beginning.  The first step toward creating a molecular machine was making a moving part. Chemists have long been able to synthesize   molecules, and they knew that interlocking rings might function as molecular parts. But how to create a second ring that passed through the first ring? Dr. Sauvage figured that out in 1983. A charged copper ion essentially acted as a pin around which to form the interlocking rings, he found. Once the rings were connected, the copper ion could be removed. These molecules became known as catenanes. The pieces of the molecule were held together mechanically, like links in a chain, rather than the usual chemical bonds. Dr. Stoddart made the next advance in 1991. Instead of two interlocking rings, Dr. Stoddart, then at the University of Birmingham in Britain, and his colleagues synthesized a rotaxane: a ring molecule wrapped around a   axle. The ring slides back and forth along the dumbbell, like a bead on an abacus. Dr. Stoddart went on to construct a small computer chip that was essentially a molecular abacus, as well as other complex devices. One was composed of three rotaxanes whose rings were connected to form a larger platform that could rise 0. 7 billionths of a meter: a molecular elevator. Rotaxanes bending thin layers of gold acted like an artificial muscle, he found. As a sidelight, Dr. Sauvage and Dr. Stoddart used their techniques to create molecules that twisted in complicated knots. Dr. Stoddart said in an interview that he was inspired by the interlocking forms in Celtic art. Dr. Feringa, in 1999, became the first person to develop a molecular motor, creating a minuscule rotor blade powered by light that spun continually in the same direction. The first motor was not fast, but 15 years later, he and his research group demonstrated one that spun 12 million times per second. In 2011, they built a    molecular car.  Four of the molecular motors acted as wheels, connected by a  . The three men invigorated the field of topological chemistry, the academy said on Wednesday. They were pioneers in the second wave of nanotechnology, a field that the physicist Richard P. Feynman, also a Nobel laureate, foresaw as early as 1959. He gave a seminal lecture in 1984, toward the end of his life, on design and engineering at the molecular scale. In living organisms, nature has produced a slew of molecular machines that ferry materials around cells, construct proteins and divide cells. Artificial molecular machines are still primitive by comparison, but scientists can already envision applications in the future. Think about nanomachines, microrobots, said Dr. Feringa, who spoke by telephone with journalists assembled in Stockholm at the prize announcement. Think about tiny robots that the doctor in the future will inject in your blood veins, and they go search for cancer cells or going to deliver drugs, for instance.  The technology could also lead to the creation of smart materials that change properties based on external signals, Dr. Feringa said. Dr. Sauvage, 71, was born in Paris and received his Ph. D. in 1971 from the University of Strasbourg in France, where he is a professor emeritus. He is also director of research emeritus at the National Center for Scientific Research in France. Dr. Stoddart, 74, was born in Edinburgh, received his Ph. D. in 1966 from Edinburgh University, and is a professor of chemistry at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. He previously taught at U. C. L. A. and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his services to science. Dr. Feringa, 64, was born in   the Netherlands, and received his Ph. D. in 1978 from the University of Groningen, where he is a professor of organic chemistry. Dr. Feringa said he was a bit shocked when he got the phone call telling him he had received the Nobel. I feel a little bit like the Wright brothers, who were flying 100 years ago for the first time, he said. People were saying, Why do we need a flying machine? And now we have a Boeing 747 and an Airbus.  The molecular discovery opens up a whole new world of nanomachines, he said, while acknowledging that, as scientists figure out how to make machines that can operate autonomously, we have to think about how we can handle these things safely.  Dr. Stoddarts name had been mentioned for the Nobel for years. It really got to the point where I didnt take it very seriously, he said. He was asleep when the phone rang at 4 a. m. I detected a Swedish accent, and I thought it was probably not a prank, Dr. Stoddart said. When told that he was sharing the prize with Dr. Sauvage and Dr. Feringa, I was totally delighted, because these are my scientific brothers in many ways, he said. James M. Tour, a professor of chemistry at Rice University in Houston, said the Nobel would bestow legitimacy on the field and help convince people that nanomachines are not just fantastical science fiction of the far future. No one is making money on these right now, but it will come, he said. These men have established and built up the field in a remarkable way.  Dr. Tour predicted that the first profitable use of the technology might be machines that open up cell membranes in the body to deliver drugs. Its really going to be quite extraordinary, he said.  Yoshinori Ohsumi, a Japanese cell biologist, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine on Monday for his discoveries on how cells recycle their content, a process known as autophagy, a Greek term for  .   David J. Thouless, F. Duncan M. Haldane and J. Michael Kosterlitz shared the Nobel Prize in Physics on Tuesday for their research into the bizarre properties of matter in extreme states. Tomas Lindahl, Paul L. Modrich and Aziz Sancar were awarded the prize last year for discovering how cells repair their DNA and protect it from the suns ultraviolet light, as well as from natural toxins and industrial pollutants.

O. Scott","text":"The first part of Lion, Garth Daviss unabashedly   movie about a remarkable   incident, has some of the scary, wondrous feeling of a fairy tale. The audience is invited to imagine a   time     1986, to be precise     before social media or smartphones or Google. In those days, a person could get lost, which is just what happens to a little boy named Saroo (Sunny Pawar) who accidentally travels more than 1, 000 miles from his home in central India to the streets of Calcutta. Saroos mother (Priyanka Bose) is a laborer in a poor village. He and his beloved older brother, Guddu (Abhishek Bharate) supplement her meager wages with whatever casual work they can find. In the first scene, they are scavenging lumps of coal to exchange for milk at the market. Later, Saroo follows Guddu to a railroad station, where the younger boy accidentally boards an    train that takes him to a city full of strangers who speak a different language. With minimal dialogue and graceful editing, Mr. Davis and the screenwriter Luke Davies convey the Dickensian dimensions of Saroos situation. He is small and vulnerable, but also smart and resourceful, and even as he is exposed to horrifying cruelty, he is also a hero on an adventure. The enormous pain of his loss is sometimes mitigated by the excitement of discovery. You fear for him, and also root for him, and mostly you are captivated by his story and the sophisticated simplicity of its telling. What happens in the second part of the movie is a little more complicated. Saroo (now played by Dev Patel) has grown to manhood as the adopted son of an Australian couple, John and Sue Brierley (David Wenham and Nicole Kidman). He has a brother, Mantosh (Divian Ladwa) who was also adopted from India and has mental health and   problems. Despite that, Saroo seems to be living in the    stage of the fairy tale. He moves to Melbourne to study hotel management and falls in love with a fellow student, Lucy (Rooney Mara) from America. But memories of his   life haunt him, and the arrival of new technology raises the tantalizing possibility of a return to his first home. Using Google Earth, Saroo sets out to retrace, on the computer screen and on sheets of paper tacked to his bedroom wall, his accidental journey. Its not a fast or easy process, and the effort takes an emotional toll on him, on his parents and on Lucy. But you know, even if youre not familiar with the true story behind Lion, that the fairy tale will come true. Mr. Davis, with strong assistance from a cast of dignified, charismatic criers and the music of Hauschka and Dustin OHalloran, floods the viewer with big feelings. If you have ever been a child, raised a child, lost a child or met a child     or a mother     this movie will wreck you. As a purely emotional experience it succeeds without feeling too manipulative or maudlin. I mean, it is manipulative and maudlin, but in a way that seems fair and transparent. Still, it isnt quite satisfying. The transition from the young to the   Saroo demands a shift in tone and genre that Lion doesnt quite achieve. What felt in the first part like wonderful, Spielbergian simplicity feels, in the latter sections, like simplification. There isnt enough of the rough texture of family life or the complications of young love to give the older Saroo a full identity. The movie hovers on the edge of going deeper into his psychological predicament but holds itself back. At the end, the focus shifts from the agonies of Saroo to the glories of Google. I cant complain too much about that for all I know, Google brought you to this review. But I also cant help feeling a dystopian chill amid all the warm don   fuzzies, a hint of corporate propaganda behind the fable. It is indeed remarkable how small the world has become, how many problems data can solve, how connected we all are to one another. But weve lost something, too, and we cant even see what it is. Lion is rated   (Parents strongly cautioned) for sex and profanity.

S. and Australian troops advising Iraqi forces got caught up in a chemical weapons attack by the Islamic State (ISIS) in western Mosul during the weekend, a U. S. general confirmed Wednesday. [The chemical agent did not affect U. S. forces and is still undergoing testing, said Maj. Gen. Joseph Martin, the commander of U. S. and coalition ground forces in Iraq.  Daesh has used chemicals in the vicinity of Mosul. The chemicals have had no impact on the Iraqi Security Forces. They had no impact on our forces, Martin said, using a derogatory Arabic acronym for ISIS. A U. S. defense official said U. S. forces donned protective gear. Australian troops were not exposed to the substance, according to an article by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). Australian medics provided some Iraqi forces first aid after the attack. A U. S. defense official said those Iraqi forces have returned to duty. It is not the first time ISIS has used chemical weapons in Iraq. The U. S.  military coalition confirmed in 2015 the first instances of the terrorist group using sulfur mustard and mustard gas. An assessment by IHS Conflict Monitor found in November 2015 that ISIS has used chemicals, including chlorine and sulfur mustard agents, at least 52 times in Iraq and Syria since 2014. Martin said the chemicals ISIS has used in the past are all   because of the groups lack of production capability. He said the chemicals were believed to have been delivered by indirect fire, meaning via rocket or some projectile containing the chemical agent. Martin said U. S. forces have the appropriate equipment and training to protect themselves from chemical weapons. The attack also raised the question of how closely U. S. forces are operating with Iraqi forces. Officials have said U. S. troops are not on the front lines fighting ISIS. However, Martin indicated they are close together and share the same risks. Martin said U. S. forces are with Iraqi security forces at various command and control locations throughout Iraq.  Being forward with those command and control facilities, they share the same risks the Iraqis do, he said. He added that U. S. forces are forward with the Iraqis each and every day.  A defense official of unknown nationality told ABC that Australian and U. S. advisers were with Iraqi forces at the time of the attack. Martin characterized ISIS as getting increasingly desperate, as Iraqi forces     backed by the U. S.  military coalition     are succeeding in pushing the terrorist group out of their main stronghold in Iraq. Martin said ISIS members were turning on civilians, killing hundreds each week. As I see it, the longer this fight goes on in west Mosul, the civilians will suffer at the hands of a brutal enemy. This is why ISIS must be defeated quickly, he said. He said ISIS was using civilians as human shields and fighting from protected sites. ISIS uses the tactic of taking civilians hostage for protection while theyre fighting from protected sites. ISIS has been indiscriminate in their use of [  improvised explosive devices] and building IEDs to kill, maim and injure innocent civilians as part of their ongoing campaign of terror, he said. Martin said ISISs leadership has fled and their days are numbered.  Meanwhile, he said, Iraqi forces were getting better. They continue to improve their capability and demonstrate a level of professionalism that makes me proud to serve with them. Its only a matter of time before they liberate the rest of Mosul and defeat ISIS in Iraq, he said.","label":0,"_deepnote_index_column":65},{"id":66,"title":"Jury finds all Oregon standoff defendants not guilty of federal conspiracy, gun charges","author":"Admin","text":"Oregon Live  by Maxine Bernstein \nA federal jury on Thursday found Ammon Bundy, his brother Ryan Bundy and five co-defendants not guilty of conspiring to prevent federal employees from doing their jobs through intimidation, threat or force during the 41-day occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. \nThe Bundy brothers and occupiers Jeff Banta and David Fry also were found not guilty of having guns in a federal facility. Kenneth Medenbach was found not guilty of stealing government property, and a hung jury was declared on Ryan Bundys charge of theft of FBI surveillance cameras. \nMore than we could have hoped for, said one of Ammon Bundys lawyers, J. Morgan Philpot. \nStunning, said defense lawyer Lisa Ludwig, who was standby counsel for Ryan Bundy. \nIm just thrilled, said Neil Wamplers attorney Lisa Maxfield. \nThe jury of nine women and three men returned the verdicts after five hours of deliberations on Thursday in the high-profile case that riveted the state and drew national and international attention to the federal bird sanctuary in rural eastern Oregon. \nEach defendant stood separately, facing the jury, as the judge read the verdicts. Ammon Bundy, his hands clasped behind his back, nodded as the not guilty verdicts were read for him first. As he sat, he smiled and rubbed the shoulder of his lawyer, Marcus Mumford. \nHis older brother Ryan Bundy stood. As his not guilty verdicts were read, he nodded, and mouthed to the jury, Thank you. Defendant Neil Wampler hugged and kissed his defense lawyer, Maxfield. \nThe coda to the stunning verdict, undoubtedly a significant blow to federal prosecutors, was when Ammon Bundys lawyer Marcus Mumford argued that his client, dressed in a gray suit and white dress shirt, should be allowed to walk out of the court, a free man. \nU.S. District Judge Anna J. Brown told him that there was a U.S. Marshals hold on him from a pending federal indictment in Nevada. \nOregon Standoff defendant Jeff Banta is relieved by acquittals \nIf theres a detainer, show me, Mumford stood, arguing before the judge. \nSuddenly, a group of about six U.S. Marshals surrounded Mumford at his defense table. The judge directed them to move back but moments later, the marshals grabbed on to him. \nWhat are you doing? Mumford yelled, as he struggled and was taken down to the floor. \nAs deputy marshals yelled, Stop resisting, the judge demanded, Everybody out of the courtroom now! \nMumford was taken into custody, a member of his legal team confirmed. \nAmmon Bundys lawyer J. Morgan Philpot, said afterwards on the courthouse steps that Mumford had been arrested and marshals had used a stun gun, or Taser, on his back. Another member of Ammon Bundys legal team Rick Koerber, echoed Philpot, saying he heard Mumford questioning in court why they were using a Taser against him. \nPhilpot decried the marshals treatment of Mumford in the courtroom. What happened at the end is symbolic of the improper use of force by the federal government, he said. \nBy 6:30 p.m., Mumford was released from custody. He confirmed that he was struck with a stun gun once while he was on the floor of the courtroom. \nI grew up on a dairy farm, so am I used to some rough treatment, sure? he said. But he said the actions of the U.S. marshals were uncalled for. \nAll I was asking for was papers. Just show me you have the authority to take Mr. Bundy into custody. \nAs to the verdict, Very pleased, very gratified. This jury was dedicated. They listened to our case. \nJust after the verdicts were announced, people emerged onto the front steps of the courthouse to tell a crowd of media and onlookers. \nSupporters of the defendants gathered in a joyous hug. One of them, Brand Thornton of Las Vegas, one of the original occupiers who accompanied Ryan Bundy and others onto the refuge on Jan. 2 and was called as witness by the defense, said that he has been at the trial since Oct. 2. \nThe verdict means everything, Thornton said. Its huge for ranchers and land rights within Harney County and across the West, he said. \nWe did something peaceful and wanted to stay peaceful, said Thornton, who has kept vigil outside the courthouse, blowing a shofar. \nThis is for the people of Oregon, Thornton said. This was never for us. \nWampler appeared on the courthouse steps and described the verdict as a stunning victory for rural America. \nDavid Frys lawyer Per C. Olson said, It was the right result. \nI think the jury saw through this that they were well-meaning, well-intentioned individuals, Olson said. The jury saw that the defendants cared about the Hammonds and didnt like how the federal government was treating them. \nMaxfield, who represented Wampler, came out of the courthouse, holding up her fists. She said she has never seen anything like this happen, where multiple defendants in a federal court trial were all acquitted, and called it one of the most significant cases in her career. \nDefendant Shawna Cox said she had a peaceful feeling, as she waited for the verdicts, but I didnt expect wed all be found not guilty. \nI wept, Cox said. It brings me to tears. Im so grateful to the jury. \nDefense lawyer Matthew Schindler, standby counsel to defendant Kenneth Medenbach who was excused from court because of medical ailments, said he called his client right away. \nHes been fighting for more than 20 years to be in a situation where a jury acquitted him, Schindler said. Its vindication. \nSchindler said he believes the jurys verdicts resulted from the difficulty the government had in proving that the intent of the defendants was to conspire against the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and U.S. Bureau of Land Management. \nThe judge gave us broad ability to bring in a defendants state of mind and what you saw was a number of defendants who each had their own motivations, Schindler said. \nWhen prosecuting a drug conspiracy, its easy to point to what the defendants underlying objective is. But in this case, Schindler said, there was no obvious underlying self interest. He said the defense also was bolstered because the jurors came from different regions from the state, and not just from Portland. \nOregon U.S. Attorney Billy Williams sat in the back of the courtroom with Oregons FBI Special Agent in Charge Gregg Bretzing as the verdicts were read. Williams left the courtroom early, before the scrum with Mumford, to attend a gathering of the League of Minority Voters in Salem Thursday night. \nHarney County Sheriff Dave Ward, who was the face of law enforcement during the 41-day refuge takeover, said in a statement, While I am disappointed in the outcome, I believe our form of government and justice system to be the best in the world. These folks were tried in a court of law and found not guilty by a jury of their peers. This is our system, and I stand by it. \nThe five-week trial offered a rare display: Three of the seven defendants chose to represent themselves. Five of them were among the more than 80 people who took the witness stand to testify. \nAnd one of the original 12 jurors was dismissed after a fellow juror raised concerns about his impartiality four days into an initial round of deliberations  what the judge called an extraordinary circumstance. An alternate juror was summoned to begin a new round of deliberations with the remaining 11 jurors Thursday morning. \nThere was heightened security in and around the courthouse throughout the trial, with security officers ordered to wear bulletproof vests, and metal detectors set up outside the main trial courtroom and an overflow room with a live video feed of the proceedings. \nOften, supporters knelt in prayer in the courthouse corridor before the trial began in the mornings, and some kept vigil across the street, with one fellow occupier blowing a rams horn, or shofar, as the jury deliberated. \nPENDING PROSECUTIONS \nThe seven on trial were among 26 people indicted on the conspiracy charge. \nEleven of them pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge. \nSeven others are set for trial on Feb. 14, but their cases may be affected by the verdicts. If convictions are handed down in this case, then defendants scheduled for trial in February might consider potential pleas. If there are acquittals, prosecutors may rethink going to trial on same charges against co-defendants next year. \nOn the eve of jury selection in this case, prosecutors agreed to dismiss the conspiracy charge against Pete Santilli, an independent broadcaster and self-described shock jock, who provided live stream footage of the occupation. \nNEVADA CASE \nAmmon Bundy and Ryan Bundy also face prosecution in Nevada in the 2014 standoff with federal agents over the impounding of their fathers cattle near Bunkerville, Nevada. \nThe trial there is set to start Feb. 6. The two brothers and father Cliven Bundy are among 19 indicted in Nevada. Others from the Oregon refuge occupation also indicted on federal charges in Nevada are Pete Santilli, Ryan Payne, Brian Cavalier, Blaine Cooper and Joseph OShaughnessy. \nPayne pleaded guilty to the federal conspiracy charge in Oregon under a potential global agreement that was in the works with Nevada prosecutors, but he recently asked to withdraw the Oregon plea because no deal was reached in Nevada. Prosecutors in Portland have until Oct. 31 to respond. \nCooper entered guilty pleas in both cases. OShaughnessy pleaded guilty in the Oregon case, with a deal pending in Nevada. Cavalier pleaded guilty in the Oregon case. \n Maxine Bernstein","label":1,"_deepnote_index_column":66},{"id":67,"title":"Clinton Campaign STUNNED As FBI Reportedly Reopens Probe Into Hillary Clinton Emails","author":"The Doc","text":"Clinton Campaign STUNNED As FBI Reportedly Reopens Probe Into Hillary Clinton Emails Posted on Tweet Home  Headlines  World News  Clinton Campaign STUNNED As FBI Reportedly Reopens Probe Into Hillary Clinton Emails \nA SHOCKING blow to the Clinton Campaign emerged unexpectedly Friday as the FBI has reportedly REOPENED probe into Hillary Clintons email server as The FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation. \n\n\nHere we go \nYes.

Mr. Pences appearance will come just a few days before Mr. Trump is expected to reveal his nominee for the Supreme Court seat left vacant by the death of Justice  Antonin Scalia  last year.

Other Republican presidents, including Ronald Reagan and George W.

Mr. Trumps pledges to them, which he made in writing before the election, have gone a long way to rebuilding trust.   activists say they are among the most detailed and serious pledges a president has made to their cause.

The same principle applies to our daily wastes. \nIn case you did not know it, Americans are among the most wasteful civilization in history. Actually, I would dare to say that we are the champions, my friends, and thats nothing to be proud of. \nWe waste at an incredible rate: absolutely anything, including food, where we lead the world by a wide margin. Also, as a nation, the United States generates more municipal solid-waste per person/per day than any other developed/industrial country in the world, boasting 7.1 pounds of solid waste a day, per person. \nIf you crunch these numbers 365 days a year x 330 million people x 7.1 pounds of solid waste  youll come up with astonishing numbers. \nPutting Waste to Work for Energy \nIt was a Greek philosopher who once said 2000 years ago that nothing gets wasted  everything gets transformed, or something along these lines. To follow this guys axiom, we can transform waste into an excellent and basically perpetual source of energy . \nWe, the preppers, can help mitigate the disaster and put that amount of waste to good use, by making briquettes using daily wastes. \nBriquettes are traditionally defined as compressed blocks of combustible material  usually coal dust, wood chips, paper, peat or sawdust  that are used to start a fire. The terms derives from the French language and it means brick. \nBiomass briquettes are starting to become all the rage nowadays and daily waste is basically biomass. Traditionally, biomass briquettes are built from agricultural waste and theyre used as a green replacement for hydrocarbons (coal, oil etc) in all sorts of applications, including industrial stuff like heating boilers and whatnot. \nCurrently, almost half of the worlds population is using charcoal and/or wood for heating and cooking purposes. \nCutting the forest for subsistence farming or for cooking your food or heating your home is not a great idea if you have better alternatives, and thats the whole purpose of technology: making the world a better place and improving   humans, right? \nAny household can reduce their need for charcoal and wood by creating their own fuel so to speak, by making fuel briquettes using waste plant material which is readily available in their own environment. \nHow to Make the Briquettes \nSo, what type of wastes can be re-used for making fuel briquettes? Paper Charcoal fines Any other type of agricultural waste. \nIts important to realize that not all waste is created equal, and this is where the calorific value of each type of waste comes into play. \nAs a general rule of thumb, the aforementioned materials are the best when it comes to DIY fuel briquettes (sawdust, paper etc), but youll have to use a home-made press for achieving legendary status, i.e becoming energy self-sufficient as much as humanly possible. \nThere are also commercially available presses. Youll just have to look for them on the internet or in   \nThe fuel briquettes are being made around the world using mini Bryant and Peterson presses. You can also make them by hand or using a plastic mold. Video first seen on The Do It Yourself World . \nYou can also use a plastic mold. Video first seen on The Do It Yourself World . \nBasically, you can use a plastic bottle or any other type of plastic container in order to shape the briquette. Youll also need something that you can use as a piston that fits into the respective container to press it, in order to get the water out of the mix. You can use something like a tin can or a piece of wood as the piston along with a plastic bag, a knife and some wire. \nHeres a cool idea about DIY-ing a mold-press biomass fuel briquette using an old DVD container. The possibilities are basically endless. \nVideo first seen on nobodyprepper . \nHow to Make Briquettes in Easy Steps \nStep 1  preparing the briquette mix \nFor example, if youre going to use waste paper and sawdust (the simplest to DIY and very efficient and cost effective), youll have to soak the paper in water for a couple of days in order to soften it and to allow the fibers to be released, as these fibers will later bind the materials together. \nIn the next step, youll have to thoroughly homogenize the soaked paper using your hands until the stuff reaches the consistency of porridge or mashed potatoes, i.e. no pieces are evident in the soup. This step is very important but it takes some time and youll have to do it well. \nTo speed up the process, you can use tools such as a mortar and pestle or a dedicated pounding tool for processing the paper mix quickly and more efficiently. \nThe simplest mix for homemade briquettes consists of one part soaked paper and 3/4 parts sawdust. You can also add pine needles, rice husks, chopped leaves/grass, charcoal fines and any other flammable materials you can think of into the mix, as theyll add to the flavor. Youll have to use roughly 20% paper though  thats the lesson to be taken home. \nYou can alternatively swap paper for cassava peels/flour, which can replace the papers binding properties into the sawdust-mix. Youll have to boil the cassava until it gets very soft, but in sufficient amounts, the cassava paste will successfully replace the paper for the purpose of binding the sawdust together. \nIn the next step, youll have to mix the paper or cassava mixture with the sawdust along with enough water. The mix must hold together if squeezed; thats how you determine the ideal consistency. \nStep 2  prepare the press \nThis step depends on whether youre using a cool home press or an improvised device. Lets say youre on the low-tech side and youre using a plastic bottle mold as an improvised briquette-making device. \nYoull have to cut the upper quarter of the plastic bottle (a soda bottle will do) and perforate the bottom, making 10-12 drainage holes. You can use a hot wire to burn the holes. \nThen youll require a thin plastic bag to be used as a liner to help you remove the finished briquette from bottle. Dont forget to punch drainage holes in the plastic bag too, both on the sides and in the bottom, so the water can be expelled during the pressing process. \nObviously, you can use something bigger than a plastic bottle, like a plastic bucket or a plastic flower pot. Ideally youll have two of each: one for playing the role of the mold and the second to act as a piston. Dont forget to put drainage holes in the plastic liner though  otherwise, the water wont drain and youre wasting your time. \nStep 3  press the mix \nIn this step, youll have to put a quantity of briquette-mix inside the plastic liner (bag) and then insert the bag into the mold. Then youll have to add more mix to the bag and press it with the improvised piston (a can, the other bucket/another bottle or whatever fits into the mold) so the water gets pushed out of the mix. \nPush as hard as you can  the harder the better. Then youll have to pull the bag out of the mold and heres your first briquette, folks. \nStep 4  dry your briquettes \nBut its not over yet.

What Does That Mean? - The New York Times","author":"Jacey Fortin","text":"What does it mean to dress like a woman? Social media users took it upon themselves to answer that very question in response to a report that President Trump wants women who work for him to look a certain way. The sentiment was anonymously cited in the new newsletter Axios from Mike Allen, a former Politico reporter. In response, Twitter erupted with a stream of photos showing women dressed for the jobs they hold and the lives they lead, as firefighters, soldiers, police officers and astronauts, to name a few. But while many of the tweets were aimed at rejecting the idea that women should be restricted to some narrow sartorial category, the dress like a woman phrase,   as a hashtag, didnt come directly from Mr. Trump. In his newsletter, Mr. Allen attributed the phrase this way: In an email on Friday afternoon, Mr. Allen declined to offer any further details. Its clear that appearances matter to the president. Mr. Trump, the former owner of the Miss Universe Organization, has come under harsh criticism for rating womens appearances on a scale of one to 10 and for hurling insults at female critics. As a candidate, he readily attacked when people commented on the size of his hands or on his hair. Like presidents past, Mr. Trump will most likely have some influence over style in the West Wing. The White House does not have an official dress code, according to its Press Office, but every administration has its own norms. For the past two decades, wardrobes have tended to be more relaxed in Democratic administrations. Under President Clinton, aides frequently attended meetings in jeans and  The New York Times reported in 2001. President George W. Bush restored formality to the West Wing, but President Obama was so relaxed that he broke with protocol, foregoing a suit jacket on his first full day in the Oval Office. If the pattern holds, dressing for work in the West Wing could become more formal under the Trump administration. Whether that means women would be required to dress like women remains to be seen.","label":0,"_deepnote_index_column":72},{"id":73,"title":"At 91, Ella Brennan Still Feeds (and Leads) New Orleans - The New York Times","author":"Brett Anderson","text":"NEW ORLEANS     A typical evening for Ella Brennan begins with cocktails. They are delivered from Commanders Palace, her familys restaurant next door to her mansion in this citys historic Garden District. Drinks are often followed by dinner, also from Commanders, and wine. Ms. Brennan favors Champagne and distinguished whites from the Cte de Beaune because, as she puts it, Im too damn old to drink cheap wine and because I can.  In New Orleans, there is little question that Miss Ella, as Ms. Brennan is widely known here, has earned her sense of entitlement. Her hometowns civic pride is tightly linked to its reputation for culinary excellence Ms. Brennan helped create that reputation, and has made maintaining it a personal responsibility for more than 60 years. At 91, she is the matriarch of an extended family of restaurateurs that employs nearly 1, 400 people, both full and part time, and she has mentored countless talents, including the celebrity chefs Paul Prudhomme and Emeril Lagasse. She was there to embrace and elevate, not just me but the entire staff, said Mr. Lagasse, whom Ms. Brennan plucked from obscurity and installed, at age 23, as Commanders chef in the early 1980s. The list of people she has impacted in the hospitality industry in America is endless.  Ms. Brennans family has recently set out to ensure that her legacy is appreciated beyond New Orleans. Those efforts culminated last year with the release of a memoir, Miss Ella of Commanders Palace, written with Ti Martin, her daughter. It was followed by the documentary Ella Brennan: Commanding the Table, directed by Leslie Iwerks. The film, which has been screening at festivals, will be available on Netflix in May. The book and film tell the story of a     businesswoman     her other nickname is Hurricane Ella     who excelled in a   profession decades before gender imbalance in the restaurant industry became a hot issue. When I first started, you would hardly ever see another woman in the kitchen, much less running the show, said Sue Zemanick, the former chef at Gautreaus, a Top Chef Masters contestant and a line cook at Commanders early in her career. Working at a restaurant with such strong women in charge gave me hope that I could make it.  While Ms. Brennan is, as Ms. Martin put it, as retired as Mom is capable of being, her New Orleans restaurants, which include Caf Adelaide and SoBou, remain an obsession for her they are managed by Ms. Martin and Lally Brennan, a niece of Ms. Brennan. On a recent afternoon, Ms. Brennan sat next to the unlit fireplace in her living room. As she moved a sore leg back and forth between an ottoman and the floor, she suggested that her impulse to empower employees was a rejection of restaurant industry norms she confronted as a young woman. In those days, no one was paying attention to developing people, she said. A restaurateur has to be part of a team to make something everyone can be proud of.  Her decision to tap Mr. Prudhomme, a Cajun, to run Commanders kitchen in the 1970s loosened the grip that   chefs had on American fine dining. Alongside Ms. Brennan, and later on his own, the   Mr. Prudhomme helped set the table for a renaissance in American regional cooking that has yet to abate. New Orleans was really the centerpiece of the whole American food movement, the New York restaurateur Drew Nieporent said. And Ella put New Orleans on the map.  Ms. Brennan entered the hospitality business as a teenager working at the Old Absinthe House, a Bourbon Street bar owned by her brother Owen, 15 years her senior. She had dropped out of a local business school after deciding, as she wrote in her book, that I wasnt going to type for any man.  In 1946, Mr. Brennan bought Vieux Carr, a French Quarter restaurant that Ms. Brennan described recently, with typical candor, as terrible.  Mr. Brennan hired her to manage the business, looking to prove that an Irish family could operate a restaurant superior to established   restaurants like Arnauds, Antoines and Galatoires. I didnt know anything, Ms. Brennan recalled. But Owen was a raconteur. He slept till noon. He got me to do all of the things he didnt like. So I learned.  A voracious reader, she pored over books recommended by the restaurants two chefs, Jack Eames and Paul Blang, whose respect she sought and whom she frequently praised. I was amazed at their talent, she said. They were like surgeons.  The gregarious Brennan family     the other siblings were Dick, Adelaide, Dottie and John     cultivated a clientele of influential locals and visitors, including celebrities. All the while, Ms. Brennan worked with the chefs to elevate Vieux Carrs food. For inspiration, she traveled frequently to New York City, where she became a regular at the 21 Club. Culinary pioneers like James Beard and Helen McCully, the food editor of McCalls magazine, took the young visitor under their wings. You had to go to New York in those days, Ms. Brennan said. I was trying to get New Orleans to that level.  In 1955, the Brennans were preparing to relocate Vieux Carr to a larger space on Royal Street when Owen died of a heart attack at 45. It fell to Ms. Brennan to carry out her brothers vision for the new restaurant, which would be called Brennans. By all accounts, Brennans ushered in a new age for fine dining in the South. It became a grand showcase for New Orleans joie de vivre, replete with a wine cellar, antiques and food that stretched the boundaries of traditional   cuisine. The national press took notice, especially of its boozy, multicourse breakfasts. America was coming to appreciate dining as entertainment, Ms. Brennan wrote, and all of the newspapers were just beginning to have columns about food.  Ms. Brennan helped develop new dishes, including bananas Foster. She pushed to expand the familys restaurant properties, with spotty success, aggravating a rift between Owens heirs and what came to be known as Ellas side of the family. In 1973, Ms. Brennan was dismissed from Brennans, initiating a bitter, litigious family split that has never fully healed. It was a tragedy, Ms. Brennan said. Family is everything to us.  (Owen Brennans sons continued to run Brennans until 2013, when a group that includes Ralph Brennan, a son of John Brennan, purchased the   property at a sheriffs auction. Brennans of Houston, overseen by Ms. Brennans son Alex, is part of her restaurant group.) Commanders Palace, which Ms. Brennan acquired in 1969, was a sprawling property in need of repair. In partnership with her sisters and brothers, she set about turning it into a restaurant that would eclipse Brennans. Early reviews werent favorable. But over time, Commanders became renowned for its sophisticated blending of south Louisiana and nouvelle cuisines     Ms. Brennan christened the style haute Creole     and its warm, celebratory approach to fine dining. We want people who eat here to feel important, and we want them to have fun, Ms. Brennan said. Ms. Brennan never presumed that her management responsibilities ended at the kitchen door. Alex McCrery, a Commanders line cook in the early 2000s, recalled that Ms. Brennan admonished another cook for proposing that the kitchen make mustard ice cream. She was the type who was like your mom is when she is disappointed in you, Mr. McCrery said. She was stern, and youd feel like you really messed up.  Ms. Brennan said she gave up men for Lent after her divorce in 1970 from Paul Martin. She also never learned to cook (I dont think she can boil water, Mr. Lagasse said) but that doesnt prevent her from giving lavish dinner parties in the home she shares with Dottie. We dont carry on like we once did, she said before a recent meal. But I do like to take advantage of living next door to my restaurant.  A waiter carried Ms. Brennans drink as she moved, with the aid of a walker, from her   parlor to her   dining room. She sat at the head of the table as Commanders waiters delivered a series of courses from the restaurants kitchen. As she sank her spoon into a steaming sea urchin and stone crab souffl, Ms. Brennan explained that entertaining gives her an opportunity to weigh in on new ideas from Tory McPhail, Commanders current and   chef. It also allows her to partake in the kind of pleasure she has provided others for so long. What were doing here tonight is letting him experiment on us, she said, referring to Mr. McPhail, who had just introduced a course of lamb osso buco. Ms. Brennan was as engaged and vivacious as when the evening began. As Mr. McPhail turned to leave, she called after him, Bring back a bottle of Champagne, will you?

And as Mr. Obama moved on to Laos for a summit meeting of Asian nations, human rights advocates worried that their concerns were falling off the American agenda not only with China but also across the region, for the same reason: Beijings continuing rise as an economic and geopolitical power. As China challenges the United States for influence in Asia, the administration is concerned that any criticism of nations like Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Laos for backsliding on human rights could alienate them rather than pulling them closer. At the same time, shining a spotlight on Chinas own rough treatment of dissidents risks losing Beijings cooperation on issues like trade, climate change and nuclear proliferation. Rights advocates accused the administration of being too timid, arguing that the United States should put as much pressure on governments over how they treat their citizens as they do during trade negotiations. Decades of experience should make clear to Washington that Beijing responds only to the expectation of unpleasant consequences, said Sophie Richardson, the China director for Human Rights Watch. Why not threaten sanctions, cut out the pointless pomp or visibly align with peaceful critics of the government? she said. On other diplomatic, economic and security issues, governments recognize and use these points of leverage. Why not on human rights? Others say Mr. Obama, who speaks openly about civil rights in the United States, has been wise not to inject the issue into talks with China, even as Beijing has carried out the most sweeping crackdown on Chinese civil society in nearly 20 years. They say the president understands that a more powerful China is better able to resist American pressure on human rights than it was a decade ago. To its credit, the Obama administration has not exacerbated the many U. S.  economic and security issues with a   human rights policy, said Robert S. Ross, a professor of political science at Boston College. It is quite a stretch to argue that diplomacy could persuade an authoritarian,   government to undermine its domestic political power by allowing greater opposition to the government and tolerating greater political instability.  The pattern is now extending beyond Chinas borders. During Mr. Obamas visit to Laos, a tiny country run by a repressive Communist regime, he so far has chosen not to publicly raise the case of an   civil rights worker who disappeared at a police checkpoint four years ago. He has refrained, at least in public, from criticizing the new president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, who has been unapologetic about waging a violent war against drugs in the first two months of his term. On Wednesday, a day after Mr. Obama abruptly canceled a meeting with Mr. Duterte, who had unleashed a   diatribe against him, the two men met informally. During Mr. Obamas visit to Vietnam in May, he agreed to lift a longstanding ban on the sale of lethal weapons without winning significant concessions on human rights. And after trying to draw Malaysia closer, Mr. Obama has been embarrassed by the countrys prime minister, Najib Razak, who has closed online news outlets and prosecuted opposition figures in an effort to stay in power. The Obama administration has pressed China on human rights in a   way on only a few occasions. In 2012, the American Embassy in Beijing harbored Chen Guangcheng, a blind Chinese dissident, and flew him to the United States. But the days when the White House could demand and expect the release of a few Chinese political prisoners before a summit meeting are gone, Professor Ross said. As the Chinese Communist Party gained confidence, it began rearresting dissidents who had been released before American summit meetings. Since then, Professor Ross said, U. S. human rights diplomacy has been reduced to rhetoric, which, no surprise, has not improved Chinas human rights situation.  Despite Mr. Obamas fleeting public reference to religious repression this week, for example, few expect the Chinese authorities to retreat from a campaign against Christian churches in the area surrounding Hangzhou, the city that hosted the Group of 20 meeting. One of the new challenges for Mr. Obama, and one for his successor, will be how to deal with Mr. Duterte. The police in the Philippines say they have killed about 1, 000 suspects in the antidrug campaign, and about 300 people have been killed by vigilantes. Rights groups have urged the United States to do something about the situation. Itd be difficult for us to overstate how grave the situation has become in the Philippines, said John Sifton, the deputy Washington director of Human Rights Watch. At this rate, were talking about over 6, 000 people dead by the end of the year.  But the Philippines is an American ally and a bulwark against Chinese military gains in the South China Sea. By that calculus, the United States cannot afford to alienate Mr. Duterte. Philippine analysts say that Mr. Duterte is on good terms with Chinese business executives who invested in Davao, the city where he served as mayor, and that he may be open to negotiating with Beijing over the South China Sea. Under American legislation known as the Leahy Amendment, Washington is obliged to cut off assistance to Philippines law enforcement units that are suspected of human rights abuses. But Antonio La Via, a professor of government at Ateneo de Manila University, said the threat of such a sanction was unlikely to be effective. The truth is that the Philippines has the money to modernize our military, he said. Mr. Obama is the first sitting American president to visit Laos, and he has sought to promote reconciliation with the nation, on which the United States dropped more than two million tons of bombs at the height of the Vietnam War. But he is also being called on to press Laoss repressive government     a traditional ally of China     on the case of Sombath Somphone, a civil rights campaigner and   agriculture specialist who disappeared at a police checkpoint in the capital, Vientiane, four years ago. Mr. Obama will also have to decide how hard to push concerns about human rights with other leaders at the meeting, several of whom are being wooed by China. One of Mr. Obamas favorite Southeast Asian leaders, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar, is scheduled to visit the White House this month, and American officials hope to make progress on addressing the plight of the Rohingya, a persecuted Muslim minority in the predominantly Buddhist country. More than 100, 000 Rohingya live in   camps in northern Myanmar, and Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi has appointed a commission that includes the former United Nations secretary general Kofi Annan to find solutions. She has demonstrated a recognition that this is a problem that must be solved, said Tom Malinowski, the United States assistant secretary for democracy, human rights and labor. The Obama administration has been less vocal on conditions in Vietnam, which it has tried to steer closer to the United States in the face of Chinese pressure over territorial disputes in the South China Sea. Since then, the human rights situation has only deteriorated, said Nguyen Quang A, an activist and a former member of the Vietnamese Communist Party who was invited to meet Mr. Obama in Hanoi but who was stopped by Vietnamese security forces. Political prisoners remain in jail, the news media is muzzled, and independent labor unions have not been allowed, despite promises to Washington. Should Obama have done more to try and influence the government of Vietnam? Mr. Quang A asked. Absolutely.

Included within this 60 percent is a 17 percent chance that the Senate ends up evenly split with a Democratic vice president providing the tiebreaking vote. By our count, the Democrats need to win five seats among the 11 most competitive races. (The Democrats will need to win six if Donald J. Trump wins the presidential race we put Mr. Trumps chances of winning at only  11 percent). Ten of these seats are held by Republicans, and one by a Democrat, Harry Reid of Nevada, who is retiring. That the Democrats are favored in this election should not be surprising. The 2016 Senate elections boded well for the Democrats without any consideration of a possible Trump effect on   races. In recent history, Democrats have done better in presidential election years than in midterm years, when turnout is lower. Most of the senators up for   last went before the voters in the Republican wave election of 2010     when the G. O. P. made big and broad gains in an   environment     leaving Republicans with several potentially vulnerable incumbents. This year, the Democrats are defending only 10 seats while the Republicans have to preserve 24. On fundamentals alone     that is, historical voting patterns, the candidates political experience and       the Democrats would have about a   shot to win the Senate. The latest Senate polling improves this figure to 60 percent. The framework for our model is broadly similar to the approach we took in 2014, when our Election Day forecast correctly called 35 of 36 Senate races. That approach means starting with the fundamentals as a prior, then updating those beliefs as polling information comes in. We let races affect one another and assume that the    errors will be correlated. The main difference between 2014 and this year is that we have some additional information to gauge candidates chances in a presidential year. Previous research suggests that there is a strong relationship between presidential and Senate voting. Accordingly, our model assumes that Senate races will track the presidential race in each state to some degree. That is, if Hillary Clinton has improved her standing in the presidential forecast since the last time a state has been polled, we   the Senate polling average a small amount in the same direction. Incumbents are running in seven of the 10 seats being defended by Democrats. All seven seats are considered safe. For the other three:  Democrats are guaranteed to win the seat in California: Barbara Boxer is retiring, and two Democrats     Kamala Harris and Loretta Sanchez     won the top two spots in an open primary.  Initial polling in Maryland showed the Democratic candidate, Chris Van Hollen, up by 20 to 30 points.  Its only in Nevada, where Catherine Cortez Masto is trying to replace Mr. Reid, where the election is competitive. This leaves Democrats with 36 seats that are not up for election this year     including two independents, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine, who both caucus with Democrats     in addition to nine safe seats. Much of the weakness in the Republican position comes from seven G. O. P. incumbents in mostly   states trying to win a second term after first being elected in the Republican wave year of 2010: Ron Johnson in Wisconsin, Mark Kirk in Illinois, Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire, Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania, Roy Blunt in Missouri, Rob Portman in Ohio, and Marco Rubio in Florida (assuming he wins the Republican primary next week). In addition, the retirement of the Republican Dan Coats along with the entry of the former Democratic senator Evan Bayh in the race in Indiana shifted that seat from a likely Republican hold to a possible Democratic pickup. Richard Burrs seat in North Carolina also seems vulnerable. Polling indicates that even Senator John McCain of Arizona could be swept out by the encroaching Democratic tide. If Mr. McCain beats back a primary challenge from the Tea Party candidate Kelli Ward, he will face a Democratic challenger, Ann Kirkpatrick, who was within two points in a June poll. Our model gives Ms. Kirkpatrick a roughly    chance of taking the seat. To give themselves a cushion in retaking the Senate, Democrats would probably need to win six of these 11 races: the seven elections with   Republicans the elections in Indiana, Arizona and North Carolina and the contest for Mr. Reids seat in Nevada. If Mrs. Clinton wins the presidency and they win five seats, they will most likely control that chamber because the vice president has the tiebreaking vote in the Senate. With so many seats remaining uncertain, the race could still tip in either direction, with Republicans possibly retaining a slim majority or Democrats running the table. As of today, the most likely outcome is a tie.","label":0,"_deepnote_index_column":75},{"id":76,"title":"News: PR Disaster: The President Of Panasonic Has Been Forced To Resign After 60,000 Panasonic TVs Ascended To Heaven Without Warning","author":"nan","text":"Email \nGet ready for the most cringeworthy story youre going to read all day. \nPanasonic might be one of the largest electronics manufacturers in the world, but after today, they may find themselves struggling to stay afloat. The companys president has been forced to resign in disgrace after 60,000 Panasonic TVs abruptly ascended to heaven without warning. \nWell give you a minute to finish shaking your head. \nThe scandal broke early last night when 60,000 of the companys popular DX802-model flat-screen TVs from all over the world silently lifted off of the ground and, despite their owners yelling at them to stop and trying to drag them back down to Earth, floated away from the mortal realm and into the kingdom of heaven to reside with the immortal seraphim for all eternity. \nYikes. Needless to say, Panasonic customers are not happy! Only a few minutes after the televisions began their skyward journey to the kingdom of God, Panasonic found themselves completely inundated with tweets like this: \nWow. Panasonic definitely wishes it could rewind the clock on this one! Chances are, when youre trying to stay competitive as one of the worlds foremost electronics companies, the last thing you want is for tens of thousands of your televisions to drift skyward into paradise. \nWeve got to give credit where credit is due: At least Panasonic had the decency to admit that they let their customers down. The company has issued a public apology, and in a drastic move, the president of the company, Kazuhiro Tsuga, chose to resign in the wake of this scandal. Speaking at a press conference this morning, Tsuga issued the following statement: \nAfter much consideration, I have chosen to step down as the president of Panasonic Corp. If I could, I would travel to Heaven and retrieve each and every one of these televisions. I would kill any angel who tried to stop me from carrying these TVs out of paradise and returning them to our loyal Panasonic customers on Earth. Even if I saw God sitting on one of our missing DX802 flat-screens, I would shove the Lord off of the TV so that I could retrieve it for our customers. Unfortunately, I do not have the power to travel to Heaven, and so I am left with no choice but to resign my position. \nTsugas resignation is a nice gesture, but it doesnt bring back a swarm of televisions from heaven. Panasonics reputation has been severely tarnished by the rapturing of their televisions. Whoever steps up to become Panasonics new president is going to have to do everything they can to prevent any of their products from ascending to heaven ever again.","label":1,"_deepnote_index_column":76},{"id":77,"title":"Judge spanks transgender-obsessed Obama: You lie! | RedFlag News","author":"Redflag Newsdesk","text":"\nBob Unruh | WND \nFor a third time, a federal judge has affirmed a nationwide injunction against the Obama administrations agenda to impose mandatory open-restroom policies on schools from coast to coast, scolding the White House for repeating old arguments and catching those who submitted the newest arguments in a lie. \nThe ruling this week from U.S. District Judge Reed OConnor left intact his nationwide injunction against Obamas decision that transgender public school students can use the restroom of their choice, rather than the restroom designated for their physical sex. \nThe White House issued the order some months ago, and when several states sued, OConnor found in August that they were likely to prevail in their arguments, so he suspended implementation of the program nationwide. \nIn October, when he had to address the issue again because of demands from the White House, he doubled down, stating, It is clear from Supreme Court and Fifth Circuit precedent that this court has the power to issue a nationwide injunction where appropriate.

The memo, a draft of which was provided to The New York Times by a State Department official, says American policy has been overwhelmed by the unrelenting violence in Syria. It calls for a judicious use of   and air weapons, which would undergird and drive a more focused and   U. S.  diplomatic process.  Such a step would represent a radical shift in the administrations approach to the civil war in Syria, and there is little evidence that President Obama has plans to change course. Mr. Obama has emphasized the military campaign against the Islamic State over efforts to dislodge Mr. Assad. Diplomatic efforts to end the conflict, led by Secretary of State John Kerry, have all but collapsed. But the memo, filed in the State Departments dissent channel, underscores the deep rifts and lingering frustration within the administration over how to deal with a war that has killed more than 400, 000 people. The State Department set up the channel during the Vietnam War as a way for employees who had disagreements with policies to register their protest with the secretary of state and other top officials, without fear of reprisal. While dissent cables are not that unusual, the number of signatures on this document, 51, is extremely large, if not unprecedented. The names on the memo are almost all midlevel officials     many of them career diplomats     who have been involved in the administrations Syria policy over the last five years, at home or abroad. They range from a Syria desk officer in the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs to a former deputy to the American ambassador in Damascus. While there are no widely recognized names,   State Department officials are known to share their concerns. Mr. Kerry himself has pushed for stronger American action against Syria, in part to force a diplomatic solution on Mr. Assad. The president has resisted such pressure, and has been backed up by his military commanders, who have raised questions about what would happen in the event that Mr. Assad was forced from power     a scenario that the draft memo does not address. The State Department spokesman, John Kirby, declined to comment on the memo, which top officials had just received. But he said Mr. Kerry respected the process as a way for employees to express policy views candidly and privately to senior leadership.  Robert S. Ford, a former ambassador to Syria, said, Many people working on Syria for the State Department have long urged a tougher policy with the Assad government as a means of facilitating arrival at a negotiated political deal to set up a new Syrian government.  Mr. Ford, who is now a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, resigned from the Foreign Service in 2014 out of frustration with the administrations   policy toward the conflict. In the memo, the State Department officials wrote that the Assad governments continuing violations of the partial   known as a cessation of hostilities, will doom efforts to broker a political settlement because Mr. Assad will feel no pressure to negotiate with the moderate opposition or other factions fighting him. The governments barrel bombing of civilians, it said, is the root cause of the instability that continues to grip Syria and the broader region.  The moral rationale for taking steps to end the deaths and suffering in Syria, after five years of brutal war, is evident and unquestionable, it said. The status quo in Syria will continue to present increasingly dire, if not disastrous, humanitarian, diplomatic and   challenges.  The memo acknowledged that military action would have risks, not the least further tensions with Russia, which has intervened in the war on Mr. Assads behalf and helped negotiate a  . Those tensions increased on Thursday when, according to a senior Pentagon official, Russia conducted airstrikes in southern Syria against   forces fighting the Islamic State. The State Department officials insisted in their memo that they were not advocating for a slippery slope that ends in a military confrontation with Russia, but rather a credible threat of military action to keep Mr. Assad in line. Once that threat was in place, the memo said, Mr. Kerry could undertake a diplomatic mission similar to the one he led with Iran on its nuclear program. The expression of dissent came a week after Mr. Assad showed renewed defiance of the United States and other countries, vowing to retake every inch of his country from his enemies. The   which Mr. Kerry helped negotiate in Munich last winter, has never really taken hold. Mr. Assad has continued to block humanitarian convoys, despite a warning that the United Nations would begin airdrops of food to starving towns. There is an enormous frustration in the bureaucracy about Syria policy, said Andrew J. Tabler, a Syria expert at the Washington Institute for Near Eastern Policy. Whats brought this to a head now is the real downturn in the negotiations, not just between the U. S. and Russia, but between Assad and the opposition.  Last month, Mr. Kerry rejected the suggestion that the United States and its allies would never use force to stop the bombings or enforce humanitarian access. If President Assad has come to a conclusion theres no Plan B, he said, then hes come to a conclusion that is totally without any foundation whatsoever and even dangerous.  Still, Mr. Obama has shown little sign of shifting his focus from the campaign against the Islamic State     a strategy that probably acquired even more urgency after the mass shooting Sunday in Orlando, Fla. In the memo, the State Department officials argued that military action against Mr. Assad would help the fight against the Islamic State because it would bolster moderate Sunnis, who are necessary allies against the group, also known as ISIS or ISIL. While the State Department has a tradition of being open to dissent     in the 1990s, Secretary of State Warren Christopher met with Foreign Service officers who had written a   dissent on the Clinton administrations Balkans policy     Mr. Christopher and his successors have been frustrated when these classified memos become public. In this case, the memo mainly confirms what has been clear for some time: The State Departments rank and file have chafed at the White Houses refusal to be drawn into the conflict in Syria. During a debate in June 2013, after the Assad government had used chemical weapons against its own people, Mr. Kerry brandished a State Department report that argued that the United States needed to respond militarily or Mr. Assad would view it as green light for continued CW use.  Three years later, the sense of urgency at the State Department has not diminished. The memo concludes, It is time that the United States, guided by our strategic interests and moral convictions, lead a global effort to put an end to this conflict once and for all.

Here are some of the most significant elements of the new approach: In 2014, the Obama administration issued guidelines for deporting unauthorized immigrants that placed the highest priority on gang members, felons and those who posed security threats. A goal was to concentrate limited resources on the most serious cases, but many Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents complained that the priorities tied their hands, taking away their discretion as to whom to pursue. Under the new directives, the government no longer will exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement.  Immigration agents can now focus on picking up and removing anyone charged with or convicted of any criminal offense, even minor ones, as well as anyone already ordered deported, regardless of whether they have a criminal record. One unauthorized immigrant in California, Kristina, who did not want her last name used because of fear of deportation, said she was alarmed to learn on Tuesday that she would now be considered a prime target. Kristina has been in the country for 25 years and has been ordered deported, but her removal had been postponed for the last four years by the Obama administration. We have our whole lives here our children are citizens, she said. Now I dont know if I can go out, if I should drive.  But the Obama guidelines translated into de facto protections for people with no legal right to live in the United States, said Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which opposes legalization for unauthorized immigrants. Unless they fell into one of the   categories, Mr. Stein said, the chance of being deported was virtually zero.  Under the Obama administration, people caught crossing the border without permission were often released into the United States while their requests for asylum wound through the immigration system, a process that can take years. Most requests are denied, but by then, the immigrant has been living in the United States all that time and may not be easy to find. The Trump administration has declared an end to the   catch and release policy, though it may take awhile to see any significant change. Catch and release came about in part because the government had nowhere to hold detainees waiting for immigration decisions. One of the memos released on Tuesday directs officials to expand detention facilities, but it will take time to build centers big enough, or find enough room in jails, to hold the thousands of Mexican and Central American asylum seekers expected to cross the border this year. The document also raises another alternative: sending migrants back to Mexico to wait out the immigration process, even those who are not originally from Mexico. That proposal comes with its own problems. Though United States law appears to allow it, Mexicos laws do not, if the immigrant is not a Mexican citizen. Two decades ago, Congress passed a law allowing the government to quickly deport undocumented immigrants who have not been in the United States very long, without allowing them go before a judge. In practice, the government has used this process, called expedited removal, relatively narrowly because of concerns about whether it violates constitutional rights of due process that are granted to anyone in the United States, regardless of immigration status. Since 2002, expedited removal has been applied only to immigrants who have been in the country less than two weeks and were caught within 100 miles of the border. That is because the Supreme Court has held that such immigrants can still be considered in transit and not here long enough to qualify for due process protections. The Trump administration is now planning to use expedited removal as extensively as the original law allows, saying that limits on its use had contributed to a backlog of more than half a million cases in immigration court. Immigration advocates vowed to challenge the change. Someone could be living in Chicago for a year and a half and then be swept off the street by an ICE agent, said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the A. C. L. U.s Immigrants Rights Project, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. He is going to be detained and removed right away without ever seeing a judge.  One of the memos on Tuesday acknowledges that children who arrive at the border alone     unaccompanied alien children, in government parlance     are entitled to special protections: Unlike other border crossers, whom border patrol agents may deport without a legal hearing, these children must appear before an immigration judge and be interviewed by an asylum officer. Children have surged across the border in recent years, many fleeing violence and destitution in Central America. But the memo turns a sterner face to their parents, who, under the new policy, may be subject to deportation or even prosecution for enabling their children to come into the country. The memo notes that parents and relatives often pay smugglers several thousand dollars to bring their children from Central America, an act that the memo says amounts to facilitating illegal smuggling or trafficking. Immigration advocates are predicting that the policy will drive parents of migrant children further underground. With parents fearful of prosecution, advocates say, navigating the immigration process     or even showing up to court     could become much harder for these children. Some 750, 000 people who were brought into the country as children were issued work permits and temporary protection from deportation under an Obama program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. Even President Trump said last week that the subject is very, very difficult for him and that he promised to deal with DACA with heart.  So far, the Trump administration has left the program alone. But chills went through the community of Dreamers, as DACA recipients are known, with the recent arrest of a    Mexican immigrant in Washington State, Daniel Ramirez. Immigration agents arrested him when they went to his house to detain his father, a convicted drug trafficker. They said Mr. Ramirez admitted to having gang affiliations, which cancels the protection offered under DACA. But Mr. Ramirez denies having made the admission, and his lawyers are fighting his deportation. A program known as 287( g) named for its section of the Immigration and Nationality Act, allows the Department of Homeland Security to train local and state law enforcement officers to work as de facto federal immigration officers, identifying undocumented immigrants in their communities and jails and turning them over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. From 2006 to 2013, the program led to 175, 000 deportations, according to federal statistics. But investigations and court rulings revealed an ugly side effect: In some jurisdictions, local officers were using their authority to racially profile Latinos. One of the most egregious cases was in Maricopa County, Arizonas most populous, during the tenure of Sheriff Joseph Arpaio, who a federal judge ruled had discriminated against Latinos in patrols and other enforcement efforts. The Obama administration curtailed the use of the program, which currently involves 32 agencies in 16 states. The Trump administration wants more agencies to take part, and some have already expressed a desire to do so. The administration is trying to significantly expand the amount of information available on the enforcement of immigration laws and, in particular, unauthorized immigrants who commit crimes. Immigration and Customs Enforcement will establish a new office to work with the victims of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants, some of whom appeared with Mr. Trump on the campaign trail. The office, known as Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement, or Voice, will provide victims with information about defendants immigration status and whether they are in jail. Significantly, funding for the office comes from reallocating any and all resources that are currently used to advocate on behalf of illegal aliens by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ICE will now have to provide monthly public reports on its apprehensions and releases. The agency also has to publish a weekly report about state and local authorities that release undocumented immigrants from jails. That is a clear shot across the bow at   sanctuary cities that limit their cooperation with federal immigration authorities, contending that turning in unauthorized immigrants would destroy the fragile relationship that the police have with immigrant communities. We are going to continue our policy that has been in place because we think that it helps us have a safer, stronger, better community, Mayor Stephanie A. Miner of Syracuse said on Tuesday. The Trump administration is already pondering ways to punish those cities by denying them some federal aid. Now everyone is going to be able to see how many criminal aliens are being released as a result of the sanctuary policies, said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports tighter controls on immigration. In January 2009, the departing Bush administration extended some Privacy Act rights, which American citizens and legal permanent residents already had, to undocumented immigrants. That meant that information obtained by one agency, like the Internal Revenue Service or Citizenship and Immigration Services, could not generally be shared with other agencies, like Immigration and Customs Enforcement. One rationale for the move was to protect the personal information of immigrants who might one day become citizens covered by the Privacy Act. The Trump administration has now rescinded those privacy protections. One of the memos released on Tuesday said that those protections had been detrimental to the families of the victims of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants, because those families could not get information about such defendants legal status, or whether they had been deported, leaving victims feeling marginalized and without a voice.  The Department of Homeland Security said it would develop new rules on the sharing of undocumented immigrants private information. But advocates for unauthorized immigrants said they feared that immigrants who had applied for legal status     in the process divulging they were not here legally     were now in danger of having that information used to deport them. The constitution doesnt traditionally allow bait and switches, said Thomas A. Saenz, the president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, an organization that advocates for immigrants. These are folks who submitted their information attempting to play by the rules, with part of the rules being that the government would protect their privacy.  The memos released on Tuesday repeat Mr. Trumps demand in his executive order for a larger enforcement force that can speed up the removal of millions of undocumented immigrants from the United States. In practice, that may play out more slowly than the president might prefer. The source of this caution is none other than John F. Kelly, the homeland security secretary, who told lawmakers this month that he did not believe it would be possible to hire the desired 15, 000 ICE and border patrol agents in the next couple of years. Id rather have fewer and make sure that theyre   people, Mr. Kelly told lawmakers. I will not skimp on the training and the standards.  On top of the stringent hiring standards and training, Border Patrol applicants are required to take a polygraph test, which nearly 60 percent fail. A previous surge in hiring under President George W. Bush resulted in dozens of corruption cases, with Border Patrol and other agents accused of taking bribes and providing information to Mexican drug cartels.","label":0,"_deepnote_index_column":84},{"id":85,"title":"Mary Tyler Moore Is Mourned by Dick Van Dyke and Other Stars - The New York Times","author":"Niraj Chokshi and Liam Stack","text":"Mary Tyler Moore, whose iconic television roles reflected the changing place of women in   America, died on Wednesday, eliciting an outpouring of tributes on social media.

Phone call after phone call from people: Why arent we out supporting President Trump?  said Ms. Dooley, a Tea Party activist in Georgia. So on Monday, conservatives around the country got out the Make America Great Again hats, unfurled American flags and held rallies at state capitols and on courthouse steps, seeking to rekindle the populist fervor that helped vault Mr. Trump to the White House and stick up for a president whose approval ratings have taken a beating during five   weeks in office. But the modest crowds that showed up for the noontime rallies from New Jersey to Georgia to Colorado offered a reminder of what liberal groups learned eight years ago in the face of Tea Party anger at President Barack Obama: Stoking   energy is often easier for the outraged resistance than for the party pulling the levers in Washington. Im getting a lot of comments from the leftists about, Your crowds not going to be as big as our crowd, said Betty Blanco, a retired teacher from La Junta, Colo. on the states conservative eastern plains, who organized a rally on the steps of the   State Capitol. I didnt know it was a contest.  About 150 Trump supporters turned out for Mondays rally in Denver, held just across the street from a park that had swelled with tens of thousands of protesters as part of the Womens March on Jan. 21. Organizers said Mondays rallies, held a day before the president addresses a joint session of Congress, bubbled up organically from Trump supporters who felt he was being treated unfairly by Democrats and the news media. Some people said the ferocity of that criticism had actually nudged them closer to Mr. Trump. I was mad at Trump for a while, absolutely, said Steve Foose, a bus driver in Middletown, N. J. and   former Democrat who joined about 200 people waving signs and flags along the curb of a   crossroads. I just grew to like him, and I would lay down my life for him.  Mondays rallies were filled with prayer, choruses of God Bless America and speeches about cutting taxes and regulations. People applauded the president and veterans, and urged one another to stay positive. But there were also chants of Lock her up! every so often, and a few shouting matches when Trump critics wandered by and yelled at the crowds. People praised Mr. Trump for actions that have provoked protests and lawsuits from the left. In interviews at five rallies on Monday, his supporters said that he was breaking the china in Washington, cracking down on immigration and supporting American businesses, and that they were getting frustrated that more people did not seem to see it that way. In Atlanta, Jermane Enoch, 57, a project manager from Powder Springs, Ga. was among the few   in a largely white crowd of 200 who rallied on the presidents behalf at Liberty Plaza, in the shadow of the State Capitol. Wearing a red Trump hat, a patriotic bow tie and a Trump   Mr. Enoch said that good businesspeople would understand why Mondays rallies across the country were needed, given what he said was the negative messaging from   protesters and the news media. Its necessary to have a show of continuous support, just like its necessary for businesses to show continuous improvement, he said. Mr. Enoch argued that the president had been mischaracterized and misunderstood. The idea that Mr. Trump is a racist, as some critics contend, struck him as balderdash. In a   turn at the microphone, Mr. Enoch said his support for Mr. Trump superseded race, and he urged a return to conservative values. Mr. Enoch brandished a pocket Constitution, to much applause. And he took a cue from Isaiah as he said Mr. Trumps supporters should not be cowed by counterprotest: I am not afraid! he said. No weapon that is formed against us shall prosper! RICHARD FAUSSET In Mandeville, a city in one of Louisianas most conservative parishes, there was some question as to how many Trump supporters would materialize, this being the usually quiet eve of Mardi Gras. But there was little doubt that those who showed up     150 or so bikers, retirees,   police officers and others     would be   in their support for a president who won the parish by roughly three to one. A home remodeler and disc jockey who uses the name Bobby Blaze made the most   entrance, wearing a suit over his leather Brotherhood of Bikers vest, a bright red tie with a gold clip and, to top it all off, a   Trump wig. He said that his father, a World War II veteran who died two years ago, would have loved Mr. Trump: The country needs John Wayne, thats what he used to say.  And after aiding its allies around the globe for decades, Mr. Blaze suggested, the United States had finally gotten such a   leader at a time when it needed him most. We cant help the world, he said, till we can help ourselves first.  CAMPBELL ROBERTSON In Cabarrus County, N. C. which Mr. Trump easily carried, more than 150 of his supporters met up outside the courthouse in Concord, many of them unfurling last years Trump campaign flags, lawn signs and red caps     though a surprising number said they had never attended a Trump rally during the presidential race. Bill Cagle, a retiree, decided to attend on Monday after seeing a deluge of news coverage of   demonstrations in the streets and at congressional town halls. I said, Well, weve been silent long enough, and weve really got to say whats in the heart, when I saw all of this vitriol the last six weeks, Mr. Cagle said. An operations manager for a company that builds towers for   lines, Mr. Cagle said he was a registered Democrat but had not voted for the partys presidential ticket in decades. He said he maintained his registration only to vote against what he considered the worst option in a primary race. What hes done in a little bit of time, I think is great, he said of Mr. Trump, noting in particular his efforts to roll back regulations. Ive been in business, and by golly, if they can get rid of some of that, its great.  TRIP GABRIEL On the edges of the Denver crowd, two men exemplified the devotion and the dread that the president inspires. Ron Kamstra, a retired civil engineer and   Christian who said he deeply supported Mr. Trumps stances on terrorism and immigration, handed out photocopied passages of the Quran that he said encouraged violence. Mohamed Mashkooke, an accountant born in Somalia, wandered up to Mr. Kamstra and said he was growing increasingly worried about becoming the target of racist attacks     like the shooting last week of two Indian men in Kansas. Cordially at first, but then increasingly tensely, the men argued about religion, immigration, faith and the validity of Mr. Obamas birth certificate. (Despite all of the facts, Mr. Kamstra is still dubious.) I dont hate Trump, Mr. Mashkooke said finally, walking away, but I think hes crazy.  O. K. good, Mr. Kamstra replied, and turned back to the speeches.

Or Anywhere. - The New York Times","author":"Mike Birbiglia","text":"This summer, I went on a   tour with my movie Dont Think Twice, a comedy about an improv group that has to decide whether to stay in show business when one member is plucked for a Saturday Night Live type of show. At every Q. and A. session for the movie, people would ask the same question: If I want to be a comedian [or actor or writer or improviser or film director] how do I get started? The truth is they should probably pick someone more successful to ask     I make small films, small   shows Off Broadway and small comedy specials for Netflix     but Im the person who showed up to talk to them. And now Im the person offering you unsolicited advice     so if you dont need it or want it, this is not for you. Anyway, Ive boiled my answer down to six ideas. 1. DONT WAIT Write. Make a short film. Go to an open mike. Take an improv class. Theres no substitute for actually doing something. Dont talk about it anymore. Maybe dont even finish reading this essay. 2. FAIL Dont worry about failing. Theres a great video where Ira Glass explains that when you start in a new field, your work wont be as good as your taste. It will take years for your taste and the quality of your work to intersect. (If ever!) Failure is essential. Theres no substitute for it. Its not just encouraged but required. The bedrock of all good pieces of writing is 10 bad drafts. Maybe 20. I wrote 12 drafts of Dont Think Twice, 14 drafts of my first movie, Sleepwalk With Me, and worked on my first   show for six years. My first   set on Late Show With David Letterman in 2002 was mined from three hours of   material that I had tried and failed with for six years. 3. LEARN FROM THE FAILURE This is where it becomes important to find a community of people you respect. People who have good taste. People who might not be good at something themselves but know what good is. They might be in a theater company, at an improv school, or live in your dorm. They arent the easiest thing to find. When I was in college, every Wednesday I drove my girlfriend Maggies Ford Taurus to an open mike at a Best Western 40 minutes away, to enter a lottery of 30 comedians trying to win one of the nine spots to perform in front of the other angry 21 comedians. It sucked. People didnt like my comedy there. I didnt love theirs. It wasnt a fit. But then I got a job working as a door person at the DC Improv comedy club in Washington, and that was a fit. Around the same time, I was cast in my college improv group. So all at once, I met people whom I could bounce jokes and ideas off of. Theyd give me candid feedback, and I tried to listen. I wasnt great at it at first. Its hard to hear criticism. But Ive learned that harsh feedback, constructive feedback, even weird, random feedback, is all helpful, if you know the essence of what youre trying to convey. I once heard an interview where Ron Howard said that he tests the rough cuts of his movies with a ton of audiences. He doesnt do it to be told what the movies vision should be, but to understand whether his vision is coming across. If not, he makes changes. Your vision is not being conveyed a majority of the time. With Dont Think Twice, I workshopped the script like the way I workshop my standup: I invited friends over to read it out loud in my living room and then fed them pizza. The pizza was excellent. The script often wasnt. So Id get my friends all drunk on pizza and then ask them hard questions like: What do you like least about the script? Be honest. I can take it.  Thats where I learned the most. 4. MAYBE QUIT You might not be meant to be a writer or performer or improviser. You might be meant to teach kids math or raise money for a food bank or start a company that makes Rubiks Cubes for babies. Dont rule out quitting. There is going to be an insane amount of work ahead, and your time might be spent better elsewhere. There was a great column in The New York Times recently where Angela Duckworth writes, Rather than ask, What do I want to be when I grow up? ask, In what way do I wish the world were different? What problem can I help solve? This puts the focus where it should be     on how you can serve other people.  5. BE BOLD ENOUGH TO MAKE STUFF THATS SMALL BUT GREAT Eight years ago, I made a network sitcom pilot based on my life. It was a dream come true. A sitcom about my life? What could be better than that for a standup comedian? Well, it didnt get picked up. I was devastated. But heres the kicker: Failing to get that sitcom was the single greatest stroke of luck thats happened in my entire career. The show wasnt truly my comedic voice. It was watered down by network and studio notes to the point of being like dozens of other bland sitcoms. After that, I no longer wanted to create projects for the Hollywood gatekeepers. The networks. The studios. Since then, Ive created a handful of pieces for This American Life,   three Off Broadway   shows, toured hundreds of cities around the world, and written, directed and starred in two feature films. All outside the system. Based on that work, Ive been offered small movie roles by people who work inside the system. Which is to say: Leaving the system behind and creating something of your own may actually be thing that gets you into the system, hopefully on your own terms. The point is, forget the gatekeepers. As far as Im concerned, what you create in a       improv theater in Phoenix can be far more meaningful than a mediocre sitcom being   by seven million people. America doesnt need more stuff. We need more great stuff. You could make that. 6. CLEVERNESS IS OVERRATED, AND HEART IS UNDERRATED Plus, there are fewer people competing for heart, so you have a better chance of getting noticed. Sometimes people say, One thing you have to offer in your work is yourself.  I disagree. I think its the only thing.","label":0,"_deepnote_index_column":90},{"id":91,"title":"Investment Strategist Forecasts Collapse Timeline: The Last Gasp Of This Economic Cycle Will Come In 2018","author":"Mac Slavo","text":"It is no longer a question of whether or not financial markets and the U.S. economy will collapse.

It drives bank lending  which can strangle the economy. But this time, the risks are much higher, and the potential economic consequences steeper. \nWe know it is only a matter of time at this point. \nGreg Mannarino of Traders Choice has made similar warnings, noting that the bond markets are signaling a massive crash ahead. And when that crash finally takes place the fall out after the debt bubble bursts, according to Mannarino, could lead to extremely serious consequences: \nSo, when the debt bubble bursts were going to get a correction in population.

The ruling effectively dissolved the elected legislature, which is led by Mr. Maduros opponents, and allows the court to write laws itself, experts said. The move caps a year in which the last vestiges of Venezuelas democracy have been torn down, critics and regional leaders say, leaving what many now describe as not just an authoritarian regime, but an outright dictatorship. What we have warned of has finally come to pass, said Luis Almagro, the head of the Organization of American States, a regional diplomacy group that includes Venezuela and is investigating the country for violating the blocs Democratic Charter. Mr. Almagro called the move a   coup, a term used in Latin America to denote takeovers typical of the 1990s in Guatemala and Peru     but virtually   in the region today. Recent months have seen a swift consolidation of power by Mr. Maduro as scores of political prisoners have been detained without trial, protesters violently repressed and local elections postponed. In taking power from the National Assembly, the ruling removed what most consider to be the only remaining counterbalance to the presidents growing power in the country. The court said that lawmakers were in a situation of contempt, and that while that lasted, the justices themselves would step in to ensure that parliamentary powers were exercised directly by this chamber, or by the body that the chamber chooses.  It did not say whether it might hand power back. Members of the National Assembly denounced the ruling on Thursday. They have kidnapped the Constitution, they have kidnapped our rights, they have kidnapped our liberty, said Julio Borges, the opposition lawmaker who heads the body, holding a crumpled copy of the ruling before reporters on Thursday. Oneida Guaipe, an opposition lawmaker from the countrys central coast, said the body would continue to do its work, even if its laws would now be ignored when it produced legislation. This is demonstrating before the world the authoritarianism here, she said. The people chose us through a popular vote.  The ruling was also a challenge to Venezuelas neighbors, which met in Washington this week to put pressure on the country to hold elections, and to discuss a possible expulsion of Venezuela from the O. A. S. on the grounds that the country is not democratic. Last week, the United States, Canada and a dozen of Latin Americas largest nations called for Mr. Maduro to recognize the National Assemblys powers, a rare joint statement that reflected deep impatience with his government. We consider it a serious setback for democracy in Venezuela, the United States State Department said on Thursday of the court decision. Peru withdrew its ambassador in protest. David Smilde, an analyst from the Washington Office on Latin America, a human rights advocacy group, said it might now be up to Venezuelas neighbors to encourage the country to hold elections again, given resistance from within the government. The Maduro government seems to have no intention of respecting the basic elements of electoral democracy, he said. Critics say a long litany of other moves by the government are taking a toll on Venezuelas democracy. Perhaps most visible to Venezuelans was an effort last year to hold a recall referendum against the president, whose popularity is sinking along with the countrys collapsing economy. While such a referendum was permitted by the countrys Constitution, and highly favored in polls, Mr. Maduro alternatively called the effort illegal or a coup staged by his opponents. In October, a lower court suspended the process on the grounds that there had been irregularities in the gathering of signatures. Meanwhile, political prisoners continued to be arrested. In January, Mr. Maduro established a new   commando to round up political dissidents accused of treason. The group has taken aim at members of the opposition, arresting many, including a city councilman from central Venezuela and a deputy lawmaker in the National Assembly. In February, after CNN en Espaol, the networks Spanish language channel, broadcast an investigation that linked Venezuelas vice president to a passport fraud scheme in the Middle East, Mr. Maduro ordered the channel off the air. The government has blocked the Caracas bureau chief of The New York Times from entering the country since October. But to many, the gradual assault against the National Assembly, more than a year in the making, was the most telling sign of democratic erosion in Venezuela. It has come in fragments, Carlos Ayala Corao, a Venezuelan lawyer and legal analyst, said of the courts actions against the legislature. They have been slicing it in pieces.  The conflicts began in December 2015, when rising grievances about the countrys faltering economy propelled Mr. Maduros opposition to win control of the legislature. It was the first time in years that the chamber was not dominated by the movement founded by the former leftist President Hugo Chvez. Mr. Maduro initially said he accepted the vote. He even appeared before opposition lawmakers to give his annual address on the state of the government in January of last year. But the Supreme Court, packed with loyalists to Mr. Maduro shortly before the National Assembly took power, was chipping away at the chambers powers. It refused to let it seat four lawmakers on the grounds that there had been voting irregularities. That denied the opposition of a supermajority, which would have given it expanded powers over Mr. Maduro. The National Assembly went back and forth on the ruling, but eventually complied. As the National Assembly began to get to work, it continued to clash with the court. By last spring, the legislature had written laws delivering on campaign promises like one measure to invigorate the economy and another to free more than 100 political prisoners, only to see the court overturn them as unconstitutional. When Mr. Maduro tried to increase his own powers under a state of emergency that he declared, the legislature rejected the effort. But the court sided with the president. In October, the court stripped the National Assembly of its power to review the annual budget, leaving Mr. Maduro in charge of the countrys purse strings. More recently, legislators tried to block the president from pursuing oil ventures without their approval. In Wednesdays ruling stripping the National Assembly of its lawmaking powers, the court said the president had the right to make these oil deals. It said its ruling was justified by the Assemblys choice to keep the lawmakers onboard whose elections had been questioned earlier. This act, it said, rendered the Assembly itself invalid. With few protesters in the streets of Caracas on Thursday, it was unclear what popular support the opposition might get from the public. Analysts say many Venezuelans feel as dispirited by the opposition as by leftist leaders, given the oppositions continued defeat by the government. Opposition leaders called for protests on Saturday and in the coming week but have been unable to draw large crowds since last fall. John Magdaleno, a political consultant, said he expected a wider crackdown against the opposition from Mr. Maduro in coming weeks, and possibly more arrests. In my opinion, from now on, there will be growing pressures against lawmakers, he said, and its probable there will be much greater persecution of political leaders.

We may pause to remark that Republicans should have been much more prepared for this in 2016, but we should also look back to 2012 because it was used in 2012, regardless of how absurd it was to suggest Mitt Romney was leading a \"War on Women.\"(Article written by John Howard, republished from Breitbart.com )Even some liberals are recognizing the absurdity, given the emergence of \"Strange New Respect\" for Romney this year. Of course this new respect is pure political opportunism  and don't be surprised to hear liberals complaining in future election that the conservative Republican presidential candidate isn't as candid and relaxed about social issues as Donald Trump was in the good old days of 2016.We should practice a little political opportunism of our own, and put the Left's revised opinion of Romney to good use. What they said about him was absurd in almost every respect. They've wholeheartedly embraced his position on the geopolitical threat of Russia, which means they're tacitly admitting Barack Obama didn't know what the hell he was talking about. They razz Trump about not paying enough taxes, but they didn't care a whit that Romney paid stupendous amounts of tax, plus vast charitable contributions.Most pertinently, they turned Mitt Romney into a misogynist clod, and his wife Ann Romney into an out-of-touch Stepford Wife, on the thinnest of pretexts. Lefty polemicists today are acting like they were possessed by political demons when they spent the final weeks of the 2012 campaign shrieking about \"binders full of women ,\" and now they can't quite remember what they were going on about.As for Mrs. Romney, she was unceremoniously stripped of her feminine identity by liberals and treated like a space alien because she dared to endorse stay-at-home motherhood. When a mild backlash ensued, the White House memorably denied one of its slander ninja by claiming to know several different people with the same name. [1, 2]In the Democrat imagination and campaign ads, Republicans are constantly targeting American woman. You can draw a straight line from Anita Hill's hit on Clarence Thomas in the Nineties, to \"journalist\" George Stephanopoulos ambushing the Republican presidential field with a bizarre question about contraceptives in the 2012 primary.It's all pure opportunism, not principle. Romney was a choirboy, so they claimed his policies revealed his secret inner misogynist beast. Trump's policies include a family-leave plan, a culture-war cease-fire declared by Peter Thiel at the GOP convention, and an unease with late-term abortion that tracks with the majority of the country. There's precious little that could be twisted into a War on Women narrative, even by the people who used Sandra Fluke to portray spending ten bucks on contraceptives as the equivalent of female slavery. Therefore, the Left ignores Trump's policies and hits his character, while Bill Freakin' Clinton gets ready to move back into the White House.In the Nineties, Democrats argued that Clinton's sexual abuses had nothing to do with how he governed, so discussing them was a silly distraction we all needed to MoveOn.org from, even when he was in the dock for perjury. Liberals of that election cycle laughed out loud at the notion Bill Clinton's libido had any effect whatsoever on national policy. He was good for the abortion industry, so his treatment of actual women was irrelevant.Partisan feminism is at a strange crossroads, as the core feminist message of independence clashes with victim politics. Women are supposed to simultaneously feel strong, capable... and be utterly helpless before systemic male chauvinism. They can only achieve personal \"independence\" through total dependence on the Big Government, which is staffed and managed by the only men in America who supposedly aren't looking to exploit them. (You're not to think about the bureaucrats who keep getting caught surfing for pornography on government computers.) [3]The great left-wing project to rewire society in defiance of biology has saddled America with devastating social problems, but that's not a problem for the social engineers. Indeed, it's more of a feature than a bug.Everything from illegitimacy, to crime, to the enormous difficulty of raising children as a single mom becomes another opportunity for them to push increased government power on a fearful, atomized population, which is rapidly losing its ability to form non-government voluntary structures of enduring social value, such as thriving small businesses and stable marriages.The dirty little secret known to the Left all along, but denied vociferously by them until their plans were fully up and running, is that most of these societal changes hit women harder, due to everything from their voluntary career choices, to the realities of child-rearing.So in the world liberals have made, single women become more anxious than ever, about everything from campus rape to the \"implicit bias\" of a systematically misogynist workplace, and they rush to government for protection from the harms caused by that abusive government.Read more at: Breitbart.com","label":1,"_deepnote_index_column":93},{"id":94,"title":"Breitbart News Daily: Trump Boom - Breitbart","author":"Breitbart News","text":"On the Thursday edition of Breitbart News Daily, broadcast live on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 from 6AM to 9AM Eastern, Breitbart    Alex Marlow will continue our discussion of President Trumps first 100 days.

S. military prison in Guantnamo Bay, Cuba, before incoming    Donald Trump takes over on January 20, the White House press secretary reiterated on Thursday. [That same day, reports confirmed that the U. S. transferred four detainees to Saudi Arabia.  The Daily Mail has placed the number of 11th hour transfers at 22, including the four recently sent to Saudi Arabia, adding that the group of prisoners who are expected to be released will include jihadists who have threatened to behead and bomb Americans. Prior to the Daily Mail article and recent transfers, the number of prisoners who are expected to be set free by the time Obama leaves the White House varied by news agencies, ranging from 17 to 19, a move that would reduce the current detainee population at the Guantnamo facility to between 40 and 42. On Thursday, Josh Earnest, the White House spokesman, told reporters: I am not able to speak to any specific detainee transfers between now and January 20th other than to confirm for you that there are likely to be some.  And whenever those transfers take place, once they have been completed, we announce them publicly.  And that will continue to be our approach through January 20th.  And my expectation is that there will be some additional announcements of that type. Asked about the risk of detainees   in terrorist activity against the United States, Earnest boasted that only nine of the prisoners transferred since Obama took office have been confirmed by the intelligence community as having returned to militant activity, compared to 21 percent (113 of 532) under the previous administration, a figure often touted by Democrats. However, Earnest failed to mention that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) figure (nine) that he highlights refers to   as of July 2016, when 161 detainees had been released by Obama, not the 183 he mentioned on Thursday. The nine confirmed   includes one deceased detainee and accounts for six percent of the 161 prisoners who had been released under Obama as of July 2016. Moreover, the number of prisoners released before 2009 exceeds those liberated under Obama more than   (3. 3) which may account for the higher rate of confirmed   under George W. Bush. The White House spokesman attributed the low percentage of   under Obama to the presidents     panel, known as the Periodic Review Board (PRB) that has cleared for release all the prisoners transferred out after 2009, including   forever prisoners, or those believed to be too dangerous to release. Since President Obama took office, and since these reforms were initiated, nine detainees have been confirmed by the intelligence community of reengaging in the fight, Earnest said on Thursday. Considering that we have released 183 detainees during President Obamas time in office, a little     math would indicate that our percentage is much better, and its a result of the reforms that President Obama instituted on his first day in office.  According to ODNI, 20 out of 161 detainees (12 percent) had been confirmed (nine) or suspected (11) to have returned to terrorist activities under Obamas watch as of July 2016. Under the Bush administration, 188 out of 532 (35 percent) are confirmed (113) or suspected (75) to have   in terrorism. When taken as a whole, if there were 20 detainees confirmed or suspected to have   in terrorism for every 161 detainees released under Bush like during the Obama administration, the overall rate of terror returnees before 2009 would be closer to 40 percent, not 35. In late December, the Chicago Tribune, citing U. S. officials, reported that the Obama administration has shared its plans with Congress to transfer out as many as 19 detainees held at Guantnamo Bay, Cuba. Of the 55 prisoners still held at Gitmo, 18 have been cleared for release by Obamas PRB and more than half (27) are considered forever prisoners, or too dangerous to release. Nevertheless, Obama has already released prisoners who had been designated too dangerous to release. The remaining 10 prisoners are believed to still be undergoing war crimes proceedings at military commissions, including at least six who were facing death penalty tribunals as of late last year. On Friday, the Pentagon announced that four detainees     Salem Ahmad Hadi Bin Kanad, Muhammed Rajab Sadiq Abu Ghanim, Abdallah Yahya Yusif   and Muhammad Ali Abdallah Muhammad Bwazir     had been transferred to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. All four detainees are from   Yemen, which shares a border with Saudi Arabia. At least two individuals     Kanad and Ghanim     had been linked to the Taliban when they were apprehended and taken to the Guantnamo prison, also known as Gitmo. Meanwhile, the    Bwazir has been directly linked to Osama bin Laden.   also affiliated with   was born in Saudi Arabia, but is a citizen of Yemen, according to the U. S. military. In December 2007, the U. S. military deemed him a HIGH risk, as he is likely to pose a threat to the US, its interests and allies.

The mandala symbol itself is a geometric construction of points, lines, planes and solids symbolizing the universe. Mandalas are geometric designs depictive of the universe specifically. Other designs are similarly meditation tools, but may not be mandalas specifically. The visually conceived geometric symbols are visual meditation tools. A visual meditation tool is called a yantra. Mandalas and all other yantras are visual meditation points of concentration. Yantras are visual meditative tools similar in value to points of concentration. The image above is the sri yantra, sri meaning king or most important. \nA mantra is the audio version of a mandala. A mantra is an audio meditation tool. Whether the sound of the mantra is a single syllable tone or a series of lengthy metaphysical musings, a mantra is an audio meditation tool. Mantras, as sound vibration, are wavy linear vibrations of connection. \nThe terms asana and mudra both reference physical positioning. An asana is a body posture as a meditation tool, and a mudra is a hand gesture or posture as a meditation tool. Asanas and mudras enable our own bodies to become a geometric representation of a meditation tool. The postures are physical meditation tools transforming self into one's own geometric figure or plane among the space and sensitive to the space of self and surroundings. \nTantra means unification, or looming/weaving together principles and practices, instruction and individual action. Tantra unites entirety. Tantra signifies confluence and integration; a fusion. It is Sanskrit for loom, the device which weaves together string into cloth. It is an ancient word with many properties and has been variously used to describe the knots of strings weaved together in a rug, and the cord on which sacred mala bead necklaces were strung, (Mala beads are Tibetan prayer necklaces of 108 beads used to assist mentally or vocally repeating a mantra 108 times.) and practices of unification of individual with the universal. Today the word tantra is often used in reference to the union of lovemaking. Though there is also a specific type of yoga called Tantra Yoga it means unification. \nThere is the potentiation of the unification of principle and practice. There is the potentiation of tantra of yantra, mantra and asana. And there is certainly the lesson of the potentiation of Yin Yang tantra. The combination of Yin and Yang potentials and energies within leads to all sorts of aspects of development. This can be energetically understood in the idea that there are only two types of energies, straight and circular, straight for Yang potentials and circular for Yin potentials. It can be understood on a tangible level that rest and work are both required. When straight and circular energies combine, a spiral results. A spiral is one of, if not the highest expressions of energy. \nMore broadly and generally, tantra notes a mutually accepted connection, a tied knot of intertwined being, like lovemaking, but not necessarily beginning with or limited to the act of lovemaking. Humanity itself is a tantra; a fused weaving knot or many strings, of many instructions and many individuals. - Advertisement - \nEssentially tantra is spiritual understanding of the relationship and connections between individuation and universal energies. An ancient spiritual philosophy preceding both Buddhism and Hinduism, tantra represents integration, unifying the macrocosm with the microcosm, the universal and the individual, the feminine and the masculine, the Yin and the Yang. It also refers to integrative knowledge and its continuation and building refinement through the interaction of teacher and student, signifying union and fusion; the acceptance, integration and transmutation of knowledge between individuals, like the string of life. \nTantric ideas enhance and explore metaphysical merging of ideas and energies. Tantra is the merging of the physical and spiritual, through the merging of the conceptual. In essence, Tantra is the integration of yantra (the philosophy of visual symbols), mantra (communication of audio symbolism) and mudra (our very physical posturing) each of which is important on their own and increasing so when intertwined aspects of yoga, and life. Tantra unites meditation practices and enhances the individual unity expansion with entirety of the universal. \nThere is not necessarily the need for a specific yantra, or specific mantra, or specific asana in meditation, however each are tools that can be used and considered, and most are most powerful when practiced in unified tantric manner, or tantric mind state. A tantric mind state recognizes unity expansion and aims toward it, rather than cultivating a mind state of separation. \nNo matter how one approaches meditation the unifying tantra of our meditation principles and practices bring about the unity expansion of yantra no matter. No matter our level of refinement of posture, we are always in an asana, no matter if we utilize mantra, or yantra, we for th most part still see and hear and those who cannot can still concentrate and connect. And no matter the mantra, yantra or asana, it is the principles behind and pertaining to the symbolism that contains the real power, the highest potential for tantric connection. Yantras, mantras and asanas establish your sacred space and sacred perimeter and uniting with entirety in tantric balance. \nSeed of Buddha Meditation - Advertisement - \nOne of my favorite meditations relates to the four dimensions of geometry, but is extracted from Buddhist lessons. It is one of the most powerful meditations I have learned and as I learned it, Buddha himself practiced and taught this meditation. I learned this meditation from a Tibetan Buddhist monk from Nepal before I considered the four dimensions of geometry applied to meditation. On later examination however the components of the meditation relate to the four dimensions of geometry. \nThis meditation is direct and simple, but can lead to infinitely complex profound lessons. The profundity of each of the ideas in this meditation cannot be understated. And each of the concepts has been elaborated on endlessly for centuries since Buddha, and so the presentation here is of course a simplification of the ideas and processes that might be endlessly explored and refined. And that is what meditation is all about really, our own personal inward exploration and refinement. \nTo begin, sit in a comfortable cross legged position on a meditation pillow. Sit for a time to simply settle into absorption and relaxation, focusing on the breath. The rhythm of the following meditation consists of mindfulness of an idea followed by mindfulness of no idea, where as much as possible we think on nothingness. The nothingness gives us a chance to relax, compared to processing the series of ideas which can all be quite intense. The process can be done in any time period. The point is to cover each idea as deeply as can be, given time or mental state circumstances. \nThe meditation is formed from important Buddhist concepts. Many meditations are derived from such teachings, Buddhist and otherwise, so that there are lessons in a sense for the secular, and meditation practitioners.","label":1,"_deepnote_index_column":96},{"id":97,"title":"Poll: Most Voters Have Not Heard of Democratic 2020 Election Candidates - Breitbart","author":"Katherine Rodriguez","text":"There is a minefield of potential 2020 election candidates in the Democratic Party waiting to challenge President Trump, but most voters have not heard of many of them, according to a new poll.

Two weeks to decide: Avoid it, and try to preserve the American life he has built for a little longer, even as a fugitive. Go, and lose it all: his wife and son, his job, his apartment, his world. I would feel like an animal if I stay here and hide, said Juan, 29, who asked that his last name not be used. I want to prove that I can follow the laws. I want to make my case at this meeting, but I know that if I go, theyre going to deport me.  In an immigration system mottled with escape hatches and hobbled by scant resources, Juan, who fled Colombia six years ago, is one of nearly a million people who have managed to linger in the United States despite having been ordered out of the country by an immigration judge     some of them more than a decade ago. And with the Trump administration intent on sweeping perhaps millions of immigrants without legal status out of the country, the White House has not had to look far to make a quick mark. Because people with deportation orders have had their day in court, most of them can be sent out of the country without seeing a judge, sometimes within hours of being arrested. People who have been ordered deported and who are still here are the   fruit, said Stephen   an immigration law professor at Cornell University. Trump has said he has wanted to deport more people. The easiest way to get those numbers up are to take those people whove been ordered deported and go after them.  President Trumps immigration agency has already offered what looks like a preview: Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents recently deported to Mexico an Arizona  mother who had been ordered out of the country four years ago. But the   will be complicated. The backlog of what the government calls fugitive aliens has persisted through Republican and Democratic administrations, inflamed conservatives who oppose illegal immigration, and resisted the immigration authorities attempts at enforcement. Since 2006, even as the overall total of unauthorized immigrants in the United States has dipped, the number facing outstanding deportation orders has grown by more than half, to around 962, 000 people from 632, 726. More than half of them come from Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala or Honduras. (Another 13, 200 or so, as of early February, were already in the custody of customs officials.) Despite the Bush and Obama administrations   commitments to focus on expelling those who pose a serious danger to their communities, slightly less than one in five people facing deportation has been convicted of a crime in the United States. The causes for delays can vary. Deportations have been deferred for humanitarian reasons     like allowing mothers to stay with sick children in the United States     or they have been frozen while an appeal is mounted. The Obama administration put off deportations for thousands of immigrants it did not consider priorities, including Juan, the Bronx electrician, and Guadalupe Garca de Rayos, the Arizona mother, often   people with strong ties to their communities. Felons, not families criminals, not children, President Barack Obama said in 2014, describing the kinds of people he wanted deported. The government also postponed deportations for people who were likely to face torture if they were sent back. Some deportations are simply impossible to carry out: About a quarter of the immigrants with outstanding deportation orders come from countries that refuse to take back deportees, including China, Haiti, Brazil and India. Mr. Trump has threatened to stop issuing visas to people from these countries. In the past, diplomats have urged caution on this front, not wanting to disrupt international relationships over the issue of deportees. And many people under final orders have slipped through gaping cracks in the immigration system. Court notices     either mailed to outdated addresses or illegible to Spanish speakers     are routinely missed, leaving judges to issue deportation orders for people who miss their chance to argue their case. Nearly a quarter of judges decisions rendered in 2015, for example, involved cases where the immigrant in question was absent. The months and, sometimes, years it takes for immigration and asylum cases to wind through a clogged court system can cause the authorities to lose track of immigrants living and working in the country, because they have fled or simply moved. The White House has sought to make it harder for immigrants to be remain free inside the United States while their requests for asylum plod through the courts. They will be detained more often, or asked to wait in Mexico until a judge can rule. There are all kinds of things in the system that werent built to maximize compliance, said David A. Martin, a professor of immigration law at the University of Virginia and a former immigration official in the Obama and Clinton administrations. It led to a climate, he said, that has prompted many people to not consider a deportation order a serious matter. And thats one of the attitudes that sometimes infuriates, with some justification, people who voted for Donald Trump.  In a significant break from his predecessor, Mr. Trump is directing immigration agents to go after virtually anyone who is in the United States illegally, ending the reprieve for people who had not been considered priorities. Ensure that aliens ordered removed from the United States are promptly removed, one line of Mr. Trumps executive order on immigration reads, with the crispness of a traffic sign. What has been lacking, up until a month ago, is a willingness and a commitment on the part of the administration to actually do it, said Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which supports stricter immigration controls. Nothing is easy, he said, but going after people who already have deportation orders will be the easiest part of enforcing the presidents removal priorities.  President George W. Bushs administration dented the backlog by deploying fugitive teams that were supposed to track down unauthorized immigrants with deportation orders and criminal records. But the strategy drew a backlash when the raids began snaring undocumented immigrants who were not targets. That was something that caused a lot of controversy and a lot of anxiety in immigrant communities, because it meant these officers could stop anyone at any time, said Randy Capps, the director of research at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. Mr. Capps added that while the Obama administration narrowed the scope of such raids, he expected the Trump administration to return to the Bush model. There is, of course, an easier way to find some people with final orders: Wait for them to walk into ICE offices for their scheduled appointments. Ms. Rayos was driven across the border within hours of her   in Phoenix, and her deportation has haunted immigrants with coming appointments ever since. But the Trump administration has yet to show a consistent hand. Roxana Orellana Santos, 37, was allowed to walk out of her appointment in Baltimore last week. Ms. Santos, who said she had fled domestic abuse in El Salvador, was arrested in 2008 while eating lunch outdoors, her lawyers say, leading to a civil rights lawsuit that claimed she had been racially profiled. She had been ordered deported two years before that arrest, after she missed an immigration court hearing. Her lawyers said she could not read the notice, which was in English. Ms. Santoss next appointment is in August. I dont feel assured of what the outcomes going to be next time, she said, adding that she had asked her brother to help her husband care for her four children if she was deported. In the case of Juan, the electrician, nothing remains to stop the government from acting on the deportation order he first received in 2013. Juan had requested asylum after paramilitary forces in Colombia tried to kill him, he said, but he lost his final appeal the month Mr. Trump was elected president. I feel hopeless, Juan said. My wife is here, my son is here, they are my world. I have nowhere else to run to. Ive run out of options. I dont know what to do.

The universities     the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, New York University and Yale     each have retirement plans holding more than $3 billion in assets and are being individually sued by a number of their employees in cases seeking   status. The lawyer representing the three groups of plaintiffs, Jerome J. Schlichter, is a pioneer in retirement plan litigation. Over the last decade, he has filed more than 20 lawsuits on behalf of workers in 401( k) retirement plans and has been widely credited with lowering plan fees across corporate America. With the suits filed in federal courts on Tuesday, the focus has turned to a   corner of the retirement savings market, 403( b) plans, which are named for a section of the tax code. The accounts are similar to 401( k) plans, but are offered by public schools and nonprofit institutions like universities and hospitals. The complaints allege that the universities, as the plan sponsors, failed to monitor excessive fees paid to administer the plans and did not replace more expensive,   investments with cheaper ones. Had the plans eliminated their long lists of investment options and used their bargaining power to cut costs, the complaints argue, participants could have collectively saved tens of millions of dollars. It is important for retirees and employees of universities to have the same rights and ability to build their retirement assets as employees of   companies, said Mr. Schlichter, a founding partner of Schlichter Bogard  Denton in St. Louis. They shouldnt be penalized.  In a statement, New York University said that it took the welfare of its faculty and employees seriously, including a dignified retirement. The retirement plans offered to them are chosen and administered carefully and prudently. We will litigate this case vigorously and expect to prevail, said John Beckman, a university spokesman. A spokeswoman for M. I. T. said it did not comment on pending litigation, while Yale said it was cautious and careful in administering its plans and would defend itself vigorously. More attention is being paid to investment costs shouldered by American workers, who are less likely today to have pension plans. With the strong support of the Obama administration, the Labor Department introduced new rules in April to strengthen investor protections, requiring a broader group of financial professionals to act in customers best interest when handling their retirement money. The aim is to reduce conflicts of interest and the fees consumers pay. Even modest reductions in costs can have a significant effect on retirees savings. An   example from the Labor Department: Paying one percentage point more in fees over a   career     say 1. 5 percent instead of 0. 5 percent     could leave a worker with 28 percent less at retirement. An account with $25, 000     and no further contributions for those 35 years     would rise to only $163, 000 instead of $227, 000, at an annual rate of 7 percent. Mr. Schlichter said the three universities plans were targeted because more people were asking questions about their retirement accounts and these involve clear breaches of the law.  The complaint against N. Y. U.     which involves two 403( b) plans covering faculty, research administration and the medical school     centers largely on costs. The complaint said that participants were offered too many investment choices (there were more than 100 options for faculty) and that many of them were too expensive. The suit, filed in Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York, singles out several investments, including the TIAA Traditional Annuity, which it said has severe restrictions and penalties for withdrawal, as well as variable annuities that have several layers of fees and have historically underperformed. A spokesman for TIAA said it offered   plans and   investments that provide lifetime income. The suit also argues that even the cheapest funds offered could have been provided for less, given the enormous size and bargaining power of the faculty and medical school plans, which together held $4. 2 billion in assets for more than 24, 000 participants at the end of 2014. The complaint alleges that the university did not use its negotiating powers to select a single   record keeper for administrative tasks such as sending statements to employees. It said it also overpaid for these services for many years. The issues concerning Yales 403( b) retirement plan     which held nearly $3. 6 billion in assets in the spring of 2014     follow a similar pattern: multiple record keepers with excessive fees, costing participants millions of dollars over the last six years too many investments of the same style and the use of   funds instead of identical but   ones. That case was filed in Federal District Court in Connecticut. Yale eventually consolidated to one provider, TIAA, in April 2015, and swapped in some   investments, but the suit claims that the changes did not go far enough to fully protect the interests of its employees. Mr. Schlichter said participants were still burdened with sorting through more than 100 options, many of which were too expensive. The complaints lodged against M. I. T. s retirement plan (unusually, it is a 401( k) like those used by corporations) are similar but with a twist. The suit alleges that the university, because of its longstanding relationship with nearby Fidelity, did not conduct a thorough search for a plan provider, which might have provided better service for less. The retirement plan offered more than 340 investment options     including 180 Fidelity funds     until July 2015, when M. I. T. reduced the lineup to 37 options but still retained Fidelity as the record keeper. The complaint said that Fidelity had donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to M. I. T. while Abigail Johnson, Fidelitys chief executive, has served as a member of M. I. T. s board of trustees, giving her influence over the institutions  . Had the plan reduced its options to those on the menu it adopted last year, participants would have saved over $8 million in fees in 2014 alone, and many millions more since 2010, according to the complaint, filed in Federal District Court in Massachusetts. M. I. T. recognized that the plan structure was inefficient, the filing said, since that was part of the reason it said it made the changes. But even after the overhaul, the suit alleges, investment costs could be further reduced. Fidelity, which noted that it was not a defendant in the case, declined to comment. Mr. Schlichters firm has settled about half of his 20 cases over the last 10 years. His first case involving a 403( b) was against Novant Health, a nonprofit hospital system, which settled last year for $32 million. In a landmark case he argued last year before the Supreme Court, the justices, in a unanimous decision, agreed that plan sponsors had a continuing duty to monitor investments and remove imprudent ones.  A series of suits, from Mr. Schlichters firm and others, continue to be filed in the corporate world: Several asset managers, including Neuberger Berman and Franklin Resources, among others, have recently been sued for putting their own investments in their employees 401( k) plans. Some of the more prominent cases against 401( k) plans settled by Mr. Schlichter include a $62 million settlement against Lockheed Martin, $57 million from Boeing and $27. 5 million from Ameriprise, all in 2015. He also settled cases with Cigna, International Paper, Caterpillar, General Dynamics, Bechtel and Kraft. Mr. Schlichter said his firm, which works on a contingency basis, typically collects up to a third of the settlement, while the remainder goes to the plaintiffs and members of the class. He said that his settlements also required employers to make changes to their plans to ensure fees were reasonable in the future.","label":0,"_deepnote_index_column":99}],"rows_bottom":[{"id":20700,"title":"Leaked Emails Reveal Hillary Cant Speak for Very Long Without a Podium So Were the Debates Rigged?","author":"admin","text":"The Daily Sheeple October 26, 2016 \nWikileaks continues to be a treasure trove of info about the behind-the-scenes rigging of what is turning out to be the most infamous presidential election in American history. \nRemember the first debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump and the conspiracy surrounding podiumgate ? \nHillary required a specially built podium under the pretext that she didnt want to appear shorter than Trump. \nAfter the debate was over, however, a sneaky cleaner man was caught on tape approaching Hillarys podium multiple times, removing various items and looking as shady as possible while doing it. What could also clearly be seen was what appeared to be a lit screen dimming specifically in her podium and not in Trumps just after the debate officially ended. \nThis led to lots of speculation on whether or not Hillary cheated during the first debate against Trump and other debates as well, having her comments fed to her. \nWell, if the Wikileaks Podesta emails are any indication, its very possible. Why? A d v e r t i s e m e n t \nBecause apparently Hillary cant give long speeches without a podium. \nIn fact, these emails (and this isnt even all of them, but enough for you to get the picture) prove her team is well aware of the fact that everything has to be kept short and sweet unless Hillary has a podium. \nSo how are we supposed to believe she was able to speak at the 90-minutes debates without prepared notes being fed to her somehow? \nEspecially that final debate where she appeared to be reading more than writing, looking down all the time at some sort of lit screen embedded in the podium as pointed out in other debates, as shown in the video above.

And Barack Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and other Western leaders are invading their own countries, says radio host Michael Savage, using a foreign army introduced under the banner of immigration, illegal migration and refugee status. \nWrites WND.com , History isnt about tolerance or peace or understanding. History is about war. History is about conflict. History is about invasions  and the most consequential invasion in human history is well underway. WND isnt talking about just an American problem, a German problem, a Swedish problem, or a French problem, but one that threatens to extinguish all of the greatest civilization ever to grace our planet: Western civilization. And this is effected via whats euphemistically called demographic change. \nConsider the United States. In 1965, close to 90 percent of Americans were of European descent, were of the Western tradition. That percentage now stands at 62  and falls further each passing day. What happened? The Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965 happened. Introduced by Congressman Emanuel Celler (D-N.Y.) and aggressively promoted in the Senate by Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.), it created a situation in which legal immigration would swell from an average of 250,000 immigrants a year to approximately one million, causing the rate of immigration to exceed the rate of assimilation. Moreover, 85 percent of these new immigrants would come from the Third World, leading to rapid demographic change. Note that this is something Kennedy had promised would not occur . \nAnd now, though the United States is teeming with unassimilable foreigners, and citizens must press buttons to conduct business in their native language. Obama has accelerated the process by inviting waves of illegals into our nation and granting refugee status gratuitously. As WND tells us, quoting Savage and discussing his new book on the subject, Scorched Earth : Were being invaded from the south. Were being invaded from the north, from the east and from the west. You might say, Well, thats the way of things, and you might get used to it. Theyre here, theyre near, theyre everywhere. The question is, why are liberals so quick to embrace this invasion, and why are traditionalists and conservatives like myself so resistant to erasing the borders, language and culture of this great nation? [said Savage][.] More than 3 million foreigners came to the United States in 2014 and 2015 according to a new report from the Center for Immigration Studies. The foreign-born population in the United States, now standing at 43.3 million people, is at an all-time high. Immigrants now make up almost 14 percent of the population, the highest percentage in 105 years. \nOf course, liberals arent only quick to embrace this invasion, theyve authored it. Why? \nPower. \nSeventy to 90 percent of the Third World and Muslim immigrants in the United States vote for leftists upon being naturalized. This pattern holds throughout the Western world. For instance, in France, where Islamic immigration has become a contentious issue, approximately 90 percent of Muslims voted for socialist president Francois Hollande in 2012. Leftists know this and joyfully import voters. As Andrew Neather, former advisor to ex-British Prime Minister Tony Blair, confessed in 2009, the massive immigration into the United Kingdom over the previous 15 years was designed by his Labour Party to rub the Right's nose in diversity and render their arguments out of date. \nBut its rendering Western civilization out of date, a fact that hasnt escaped hostile foreign entities. As late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi said in 2006 while commenting on the cold invasion, We have 50 million Muslims in Europe. There are signs that Allah will grant Islam victory in Europe  without swords, without guns, without conquest  will turn it into a Muslim continent within a few decades. \nAnd the enemy within, as Savage would put it, celebrates this rending of the West with a demonic hatred of what should be their own culture. Just consider that Swedish multiculturalist social engineer and Social Democrat politician Mona Sahlin actually said in 2001 that \"the Swedes must be integrated into the new Sweden; the old Sweden is never coming back.\" Of course, if a corresponding sentiment had been expressed by a backwoods tribesman about his own tribe, it would be viewed as most odd; many would call him a traitor. And when a rainforest-dwelling tribe is overwhelmed by outsiders  or when the Tibetans are inundated with ethnic Chinese, which has been happening  anthropologists will condemn it as demographic and cultural genocide. In the West, though, its marketed as multiculturalism. \nAnd were told, Our strength lies in our diversity. \nObama knows precisely what hes doing, too, says Savage, and is purposely deconstructing our nation. Obama is invading his own country. Hes destroying it from within, like a worm in an apple, said the radio host. No doubt. In fact, Obama stated last year that over the long term he was pretty optimistic that conservatism would be extinguished because this country just becomes more and more of a hodgepodge of folks. \nEven more damningly, it was alleged in 2015 that theres a secret Obama administration plot to use the new illegal aliens as seedlings that will develop a country within a country; these foreigners will navigate, not assimilate as they eventually take over the host, coming out of the shadows and pushing the citizens into the shadows, the report informed . \nIn this vein, WND mentions that at issue isnt just the massive number of im/migrants, but also their nature. The site further points out that this creeping Third Worldism has already turned states such as California into socialist bastions that vote reliably Democrat. For sure. As I wrote in 2010, placing the matter in perspective: If we imported millions of Scandinavians  who have created the most liberal governments on Earth  would we expect them to magically change their ideology upon seeing American terra firma? If not, why would we expect otherwise with south-of-the-border socialists? If they choose Hugo Chavez and Evo Morales types below the Rio Grande, why wouldnt they above it? Geography doesnt change ideology. \nIt doesnt change jihadist zeal, either. Referring to the recent influx of Muslim migrants into the United States  Obama has welcomed more than 13,000 almost exclusively Muslim Syrian refugees already this year  Savage mentioned that these individuals cannot actually be vetted and thus are unknown quantities. Moreover, he points out that Obama is preventing border-patrol agents and the police from enforcing immigration law, as the president invades his own country with a de facto army from other nations, as the radio legend put it. He characterizes Obama as dangerous and as a psychopath bent on replacing the population of his own country. \nOf course, Obama did telegraph his intentions in 2008, promising fundamental change. Note that fundamental means  serving as, or being an essential part of, a foundation or basis . If a man says his wife requires fundamental change, he doesnt just mean she needs a new hairdo or wardrobe, or even cosmetic surgery. He means that he doesnt like the very essence of what she is and wants her transformed into a completely different person. \nAs for the Lefts destruction of the West, it will continue unless and until Western voters enforce fundamental change  and divorce leftism, permanently, from their cultures and governments.

Davis, who claimed she was acting under Gods authority and quickly became a hero for many religious conservatives, has been hit with an appeal seeking to have her pay her opponents legal fees, which total $233,058. \nDavis legal troubles began soon after her stunt last summer when four couples (two same-sex and two straight) sued her for her refusal to carry out national law. The case gained national attention after Davis was briefly imprisoned for contempt of court and made a martyr of herself. The suit itself was ultimately resolved earlier this year after Kentuckys governor changed state law to the effect that county clerks no longer authorize marriage licenses. \nDavis has not been responsible for her own legal fees, as the anti-LGBT non-profit Liberty Counsel has offered her pro bono services. Now, however, she may finally be forced to pay up as the ACLU, on behalf of the four plaintiff couples, is appealing to US District Judge David Bunning seeking an order allowing them to recoup their legal expenses. Rowan County, which Davis serves as county clerk, has already stated that it will not pay the costs, arguing that Davis was acting on her own behalf rather than the countys. \nIt remains to be seen how the appeal will play out. According to William Sharp, the ACLU of Kentuckys legal director, \n Courts recognize that when successful civil rights plaintiffs obtain a direct benefit from a court-ordered victory, such as in this case, they can be entitled to their legal expenses to deter future civil rights violations by government officials. By filing todays motion, we hope to achieve that very objective  to send a message to government officials that willful violations of individuals rights will be costly \nLiberty Counsel, however, is contesting the appeal on the grounds that Davis did not technically lose the case since it was resolved by a change in state law.","label":1,"_deepnote_index_column":20702},{"id":20703,"title":"Ethics Complaint Filed Against Rep.

The Dallas Cowboys new headquarters is sparkly and showy and so     that it makes the teams longtime base of operations     in Irving, about 20 miles southwest of here     look like your grandparents   rec room. The complex is like an airy, marbled museum, with reminders, maybe every 10 steps, that the Cowboys once were a dynasty: Super Bowl rings, Super Bowl trophies and hagiographic displays of all five of the franchises Super Bowl victories. But the shiniest part of the Cowboys these days was not in the complexs blueprints: Its Dak Prescott, who came out of nowhere to become the teams new franchise quarterback. Prescott, a rookie drafted in the fourth round out of Mississippi State, led the team to 11 victories in a row before Sundays visit to New Jersey to face the Giants, a feat that not even Troy Aikman or Roger Staubach can claim. But in a visit to Frisco last week, it became even more clear how much Prescotts ascent, like the teams gleaming new home, is yet another reminder of one man the Cowboys have left behind: Tony Romo. I know he wants to play and I know he wants to be out there, but hes been really good about everything, Prescott said of Romo. Hes telling me about   and things he sees with a defense, or things he has seen in the past. Hes great.  The Great Tony Romo? Youll have to think back a while to remember how great. Romo was the undrafted rookie who became a Pro Bowl player, leading the Cowboys to four playoff berths and posting only two losing seasons after taking over as the starter in 2006. But while his career propelled the Cowboys forward year after year, it is also sometimes remembered for what Romo did not do when it mattered most. There was the botched hold on a   attempt that probably cost the Cowboys a chance for a playoff win at Seattle in 2007. The loss to the Giants in the postseason a year later that spoiled a   season. The    fades. The poorly thrown balls and the dozens of sacks. And then there were the injuries, which continue to thwart him. Prescott is starting at all only because Romo broke a bone in his back in the preseason     after his 2015 season ended early, to boot. Now Romo, 36, is stuck in a position thats dreaded by every top athlete who knows the clock is ticking on his career: Hes watching the young Prescott lead the greatest Cowboys team in years to the playoffs, and knowing that wherever they go, he will only be along for the ride. Hes earned the right to be our quarterback, as hard as it is for me to say, Romo said of Prescott in what amounted to an official concession speech last month. What is clear is that I was that kid once.  When Romo was that kid, it was all so much fun. He sang Journeys Dont Stop Believin at his locker, and he joked with the reporters who scribbled down his every word. Even when he was injured, he would brush off his physical problems because he was absolutely positive that he would come back, even better than ever. Most of the time, he was right. When things dont go your way, he once told me, you just have to come right back and say: Lets try this again. Lets have some fun.  Romo doesnt look as if hes having any fun now. The black vinyl seat at his locker was empty when I visited Texas last week. Next to it was a pile of papers with information about the Giants, and how the Cowboys would match up. Romo had scribbled notes in the margins, knowing full well that it was unlikely that he would play. He doesnt need to talk with reporters, and so, generally, he doesnt. Its a jarring change. When I covered the Cowboys for The Dallas Morning News in 2003, just after Romo was signed as a rookie free agent, I could always find him on the blue leather couches in the locker room, a motivational book in hand, the dimple on his left cheek showing because he was nearly always smiling. For three seasons, Romo sat and watched the Cowboys burn through quarterback after quarterback: Quincy Carter, Drew Henson, Vinny Testaverde, Drew Bledsoe. Romo, a friendly son of Wisconsin, seemed to know his time would come. And just like that, midway through the 2006 season, it did. He came in for Bledsoe against the Giants, and he never looked back. O. K. thats an exaggeration. Hes probably looking back now. And who would blame him for being nostalgic? Now likely closer to his 40th birthday than he is to starting in a Super Bowl, he must wonder if he will ever take a snap for the Cowboys     for anyone     again. Others on the team must be wondering the same thing, though they wont admit it. I want to do what gives us the best chance to have Tony contribute to a championship, the owner Jerry Jones said on his radio show last week. Tonys ready to go Tonys not done, said Scott Linehan, the Cowboys offensive coordinator. Tight end Jason Witten, Romos close friend and his favorite receiver, struggled to even consider the idea that Romo might never throw him another pass. He fidgeted as he considered his answer and admitted that he didnt really want to give one. He and Romo were rookies together. They became the franchise players together. They even became fathers at about the same time. Weve kind of grown up together and went from being kids to being men at the same time, Witten said. I know that Tonys always going to be the same guy, no matter what situation hes dealing with, and I also believe he can still get it done on the field.  He paused for a moment before adding, But this game doesnt slow down for anybody, and Tony understands that.  Walking through the locker room in Frisco on Thursday, Romo looked less like an N. F. L. starter and more like someone who had just rolled out of bed. Tousled hair. Unshaven face. Baggy sweatpants. Head down and silent. Across the room, Prescott engaged a crowd of reporters. He is now the star of the show.","label":0,"_deepnote_index_column":20705},{"id":20706,"title":"As America Sleeps, Donald Trump Seethes on Twitter - The New York Times","author":"Michael Barbaro, Maggie Haberman and Alan Rappeport","text":"The tweets started around 3:20 a. m. on Friday. Inside Trump Tower, a restless figure stirred in the predawn darkness, nursing his grievances and grabbing a device that often lands him in hot water. On his Android phone, Donald J. Trump began to tap out bursts of digital fury: He mocked Alicia Machado, a former Miss Universe and a popular Latin American actress, as a con, the worst and disgusting.  In a final flourish, before the sun came up, the Republican presidential nominee claimed     without offering any evidence     that she had appeared in a sex tape.  The tirade fit a pattern. It is when Mr. Trump is alone with his thoughts, and untethered from his campaign staff, that he has seemed to commit his most   acts. There has always been this dangerous part of him that will go too far and do something that backfires, said Michael DAntonio, the author of The Truth About Trump, a new biography of the real estate mogul. His worst impulses, he added, are  .  Over the past few days, those instincts have been on vivid display. In quick succession, Mr. Trump has repeated his critique that Ms. Machado gained a massive amount of weight after she won the Miss Universe crown in 1996 suggested that former President Bill Clintons infidelities are fair game for campaign attacks and urged his followers to check out a sex tape that may not exist. (Ms. Machado appeared in a risqu scene on a reality television show, but   have discovered no sex tape.) The eruptions could further damage Mr. Trumps reputation with women and Latino voters at a time when he can scarcely afford to alienate either group, five and a half weeks before Election Day. Yet for close students of Mr. Trumps career and campaign, it all has a familiar ring. Over the years, he has issued a stream of needlessly cruel and seemingly    insults     both on and off social media     that have inflamed the public. He declared on Twitter that Kim Novak, a reclusive    actress at the time, should sue her plastic surgeon, sending her into hiding. He derided the appearance of a rival, Carly Fiorina, angering female voters by asking: Can you imagine that, the face of our next president? And he criticized the mother of a slain American soldier, musing that as a Muslim woman, she was not allowed to speak. Such fulminations have almost always arisen from Mr. Trumps wounded pride, after he has been attacked or has suffered a setback. And they have frequently played out on Twitter, at hours of the day when much of America is asleep. The   tweets about Ms. Machado were a reminder, said the Republican strategist Charles Black, that Mr. Trump cannot let something drop until he proves hes right, and its beside the point whos right.  Around midnight one night during the primary campaign, he posted an unflattering photo of Heidi Cruz, the wife of a Republican rival, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Early one morning, he alleged a sexual affair between two   television anchors who had criticized him. Early one Saturday, he distributed an image of Mrs. Clinton, surrounded by falling cash and a   star that many said was a Star of David and was  . And at 11 one evening, he shared a digitally altered image of Jeb Bush appearing to pick his nose. Late night   Donald is back at it! an aide to Mr. Bush replied at the time. On Friday, Mr. Trump was at it again between 3:20 and 5:30 a. m. issuing a series of indignant messages that mocked Ms. Machado and Mrs. Clinton, who raised the experience of the former beauty queen to hurt Mr. Trump during the debate. Mrs. Clinton, he wrote, was duped and used by my worst Miss U. Hillary floated her as an angel without checking her past, which is terrible! A few minutes later, Mr. Trump theorized     again, without offering any evidence     that Mrs. Clinton had helped Ms. Machado become a United States citizen so that the Democratic nominee could mention the beauty queen in the debate to hurt Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump, in an interview on Friday afternoon, said he remained proud of his tweets. Why would I have regrets? Im a very truthful person, and Im telling the truth. Now people understand it. And before the tweets, people didnt understand it.  It is unusual for a major party presidential nominee to directly control any online communications, let alone issue provocative, unsubstantiated claims without the filter of a campaign aide. But Mr. Trump is fixated on Twitter. He has nearly 12 million followers and has reveled in watching his stray thoughts become viral sensations on the social media platform. He has been fond of quoting a fan on Twitter, who described him as the Ernest Hemingway of a hundred and forty characters.  So like a car careening down a highway with no guardrails, Mr. Trump on Friday sent out one message after another. His suggestion of a sex tape featuring Ms. Machado sent his most zealous followers hunting for images. A few of them posted pornographic images of women who they believe resembled Ms. Machado. Ms. Machado on Friday called Mr. Trumps online assault cheap lies with bad intentions and said that she would not be intimidated. Aides to Mrs. Clinton, who have long warned of his reckless ways on Twitter, said Mr. Trumps behavior had once again bolstered their argument that he is mentally unfit for the presidency. I mean, his latest Twitter meltdown is unhinged, even for him, Mrs. Clinton said on Friday. Really, who gets up at 3 oclock in the morning to engage in a Twitter attack against a former Miss Universe? she asked. Many wondered aloud on Friday whether Mr. Trumps erratic   behavior is the result of disorienting insomnia, since he regularly boasts of needing only a few hours of sleep. But Mr. Trump quickly rejected that theory. For those few people knocking me for tweeting at three oclock in the morning, at least you know I will be there, awake, to answer the call! Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. Not everyone in his life seems so sure. Asked this year which habit she wished her husband would quit, Melania Trump gave a   answer: tweeting.","label":0,"_deepnote_index_column":20706},{"id":20707,"title":"OPEC, Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi: Your Wednesday Evening Briefing - The New York Times","author":"Karen Zraick and Sandra Stevenson","text":"(Want to get this briefing by email? Heres the  .) Good evening. Heres the latest. 1.   Donald Trump announced on Twitter that he would take steps to separate from his business empire. The Office of Government Ethics said only a divestiture of his financial stake in his real estate business would resolve ethical concerns about conflicts of interest. Mr Trump also unveiled his economic team of investment titans. His secretary of the Treasury, Steven Mnuchin, above, promised sizable corporate tax cuts in an appearance on CNBC. Sarah Palin is being considered for Veterans Affairs. Next up: Rallies in states that were crucial to his victory, beginning in Cincinnati. One of the stops will be at a  plant in Indiana run by Carrier, which decided against moving about 1, 000 jobs to Mexico after pressure from Mr. Trump. ____ 2. Do we have to report everything Mr. Trump tweets? Typically,   hold news conferences after the election. Mr. Trump has not, instead exhibiting an unprecedented reliance on social media. Editors and reporters said they planned to apply the same news judgment to tweets they would to any statement by a powerful leader. But they acknowledged that the medium allows Mr. Trump to reduce complicated subjects to snappy and sometimes misleading slogans. ____ 3. Nancy Pelosi retained her post as the Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, but about a third of House Democrats voted for her challenger, Tim Ryan, a    Ohioan from a   district. After a dismal Election Day for Democrats, the fight for the role had become a proxy battle for the future of the party. ____ 4. A Charlotte, N. C. police officer will not face charges in the fatal shooting in September of a black resident, Keith Lamont Scott, above. The killing set off days of unrest. Mr. Scotts wife recorded the confrontation, in which she yells that he is unarmed. But prosecutors said Mr. Scott was, after all, carrying a handgun. ____ 5. OPEC agreed to cut oil production for the first time in eight years. But for the   deal to work,   member Russia must cooperate. While the announcement sent oil prices soaring, theyre nowhere near historic highs. Above right, the Saudi energy minister at the groups meeting in Vienna. ____ 6. The chartered plane that crashed in Colombia, killing almost all aboard, including members of a Brazilian soccer team, may have run out of fuel. In a recording circulating on Colombian media, the pilot pleaded for immediate landing rights, telling an air traffic controller that the plane was in total failure, total electrical failure, without fuel.  Above, a tribute to the team at its stadium in Chapeco, Brazil. ____ 7. Drug regulators approved   clinical trials to study MDMA, the illegal party drug better known as Ecstasy, as treatment for   stress disorder. It changed my life, said the veteran above, who had PTSD after three tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. It allowed me to see my trauma without fear or hesitation and finally process things and move forward.  ____ 8. Snapchats parent company, Snap, is headed for a blockbuster I. P. O. It has overtaken Twitter in terms of daily users, and its new gadget is selling fast: sunglasses, above, that record video clips. The service is still frequently dismissed by people over 25. If you are one of them, our tech writer says its time to reconsider. ___ 9. We asked five writers and showrunners who have worked on programs like Homeland and Quantico about whether TV can be fair to Muslims. The takeaways: Theres an oversize appetite for stories about terrorism, and not enough diversity in the industry. When   are writing for some characters, it either becomes theyre terrorists or theyre so P. C. that they end up writing sanctified characters, who are so good and so  said the actor Aasif Mandvi, formerly of The Daily Show.  ____ 10. Chronic insomniacs, take heart. New online programs that use cognitive behavior therapy helped more than half of the subjects in a study within weeks. ___ 11. Finally, British vegetarians are furious. The Bank of England confirmed that tallow, which is made from beef or mutton fat, was used in the more durable   bills it introduced recently. Being forced to pay taxes to contribute to animal products is a breach of rights, one vegan wrote on Twitter. Shut. up. omnivores. You have no say in this.

[The statement says:  The March for Life congratulates the U. S. House of Representatives for passing the American Healthcare Act and for reaffirming their commitment to life. Abortion is not healthcare, and in light of that     this bill provides   protections and redirects funding away from        Americas largest abortion provider, Planned Parenthood, to community health centers that offer comprehensive womens care, and already outnumber Planned Parenthood clinics by 20 to 1.

According to its latest annual report ( ) Planned Parenthood provided 323, 999 abortions between    and    and was given $553. 7 million in health services grants and reimbursements.

In fact, it seems that her dirty deeds from 2011 just came to the surface in the form of a sex bombshell  and not even she could hide it forever. \nWith the FBI reopening its investigation into Hillarys emails and private server, on account of another case into Anthony Weiners sexting of an alleged minor, it seems that there are some startling details coming forward. Although we all know that Weiner is a long-time pervert and sexual predator, it looks like things have been going on for longer than we thought  and Hillary knew about it all along. Everyone who knew Anthony Weiner targeted underage girls back in 2011: John Podesta, Neera Tanden, and Hillary Clinton (left), and Jennifer Palmieri (right) \nAccording to Mail Online , Hillarys camp knew that Weiner was talking to and sending sexually graphic images to an underage girl all the way back in 2011, yet they did nothing to stop him. In fact, Jennifer Palmieri, the campaign communications director in 2011, sent an email to John Podesta, now chair of Clintons presidential campaign, and Neera Tanden, another Clinton adviser, detailing Weiners predatory and criminal behavior. \nMarried to Hillarys current top aide, Huma Abedin, at the time, Weiners indiscretions were made public knowledge to Hillarys camp and only met with a mere oof from Podesta. Further reports indicate that police were sent to the 17-year-old girls home at the time to interview both the child and her parents. Anthony Weiner and his sex pics \nOf course, as we all know now, Weiner has come under official investigation after sending lewd messages to a different 15-year-old girl more recently. However, one can only wonder if Weiners most recent victim could have been spared if his predatory behavior was addressed back in 2011 rather than swept under the rug. \nAlthough hes been widely deemed the black sheep of the political realm, it certainly appears that his divorce and early resignation was the least of concern pertaining to the fallout of his behavior. Seeing how the most recent of Weiners consequences just slapped Hillary, it doesnt take much to imagine the hell hes living in right now. Anthony Weiner and steamy messages he sent to a woman other than his wife \nHowever, it is good to have these things out in the open as it helps show the true Hillary Clinton  the one she never wanted you to know about. Theres no question that Hillary would do whatever it took to remain in power, but this is just ridiculous. \nBecause of her neglect and the blind eye turned by her staff, an underage girl was allowed to be victimized because the truth would have a negative effect on them. There really is no jail cell thats suited for what Hillary deserves but she will most certainly have to answer for her misdeeds after shes dead and gone from this earth  and suffering for an eternity sounds rather fitting for the vile things shes done.","label":1,"_deepnote_index_column":20710},{"id":20711,"title":"Celebrities Rage at House Obamacare Repeal: F*ck All Yall","author":"Daniel Nussbaum","text":"Republican leaders and President Donald Trump celebrated a legislative victory Thursday as the House passed the American Health Care Act, which, if it clears the Senate and is signed into law, will repeal former President Obamas signature achievement, 2010s Affordable Care Act.

Some of those in the establishment who felt his wrath were the neoconservatives and liberal interventionists, as Trump thoroughly tore apart the Iraq War and the belligerent rhetoric of both Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton.\nFor the average voter, the message was clear: a vote for Trump was a vote against trying to remake the world in Americas image through force. \nOr was it? Because the nominees being floated so far for key positions in the incoming Trump Administration are completely at odds with a more realist and humble foreign policy.\nOne of the names being floated for secretary of state is former UN Ambassador John Bolton, a man so hawkish that even a Republican Senate would not confirm him for the post after his recess appointment by President George W. Bush. Part of the reason was Bolton was on record claiming,  There is no such thing as the United Nations, and fully endorsing unilateralism.\nBolton is a neocon through and through. If he runs the State Department, expect an aggressive US posture in the world.\nAnother one of Trumps foreign policy advisors is former CIA Director James Woolsey. Woolsey is an arch-neocon who pushed some of the most weakly-sourced talking points in the run up to the Iraq War, including that Iraq was connected to the 9/11 attack. Unlike Trump, Woolsey does not believe the war was a mistake and defended the decisions as recently as 2015.\nBolton? Woolsey? Why does Trump want to bring in the architects of the Iraq War into his administration? \nWhile it is true no official nominations or appointments have been made, that these people are even being considered is arguably a betrayal of Trumps campaign promise to change course on foreign policy. It also completely contradicts Trumps famous line that the problem with US foreign policy is that its run by stupid people. \nGuess what Trump?

But not this one. Loaded with roasted vegetables and cheese on a   crust, its a hearty meal that you can eat out of hand, with your pinkie occupied by holding the slice. Its gorgeous, too. With a mixture of velvety butternut squash, earthy mushrooms and sweet green leeks, this tart makes for an especially pretty yet satisfying vegetarian meal. The crust is made with yeast, which is what really makes this tart rustic, rather than refined. If working with yeast makes you nervous, this recipe is a good place to begin. The dough is so simple you can mix it by hand with a wooden spoon and then knead it for just a few minutes, until it starts to spring back when you pull it. It should be somewhat elastic but not bouncy. Think Silly Putty rather than Spaulding. Then set the dough aside to rise. The warmer your room, the less time it will take to double in bulk. In a cold room it could take two or three hours, whereas a warm room gets the job done in half that amount of time. Or let it rise in the fridge overnight. Its a very adaptable recipe. The   flour in the dough gives it heft, along with a gentle nuttiness. I like either   or rye flour here, but you can substitute spelt or einkorn. Just be sure to use a flour with gluten in it. In this particular recipe,   flours (brown rice, millet, oat) wont bake up as pleasingly chewy. Ive topped the tart with mushrooms, leeks and winter squash, all roasted before they meet the crust. This is an important step. You want to roast the vegetables until they are almost, but not quite, caramelized. They should be pale golden at the edges and tender in the center when you pull them from the oven, but not thoroughly browned because they will continue to cook when you bake them on the crust. You can roast the vegetables up to eight hours in advance, but the tart itself is best made within an hour or two of serving. Thats when the crust is at its most crisp and the cheese still soft and oozing. That said, you can still enjoy the tart the next day, especially if you reheat it. Leftover and cold, eaten wrapped in a napkin on your way out the door, this robust tart can hold its own. Recipe: Roasted Mushroom and Butternut Squash Tart And to Drink . .. This savory tart presents a challenge. Mushrooms go beautifully with red wines, while leeks, squash and cheese all cry out for whites. Pick whichever you prefer, but avoid tannic reds and oaky whites. In reds, I would look for something fruity and balanced: Pinot noir would be great, as would Beaujolais, young Riojas and the more restrained American grenaches and carignans. You could try monastrells and other wines from southeastern Spain, and Valpolicellas from Italy. Among whites, I would look at dry chenin blancs from the Loire Valley, unoaked chardonnays and possibly rieslings from Austria or Alsace. A dry sparkling wine would also be excellent.

(AP Photo/Hani Mohammed) \nAfter a solid 19 months of endorsing the Saudi war in Yemen, selling the Saudis massive amounts of arms, and refueling Saudi bombers over Yemens airspace, the Obama Administration today called on the Saudis to halt airstrikes against Yemen, and accept that there is no military solution. \nA top Human Rights Watch director noted that the call wouldve carried a lot more weight if the US wasnt providing the bombs the Saudis are dropping on Yemen in the first place, though former US officials say its almost certain this wont include any dial back in US arms sales. \nThe call likely reflects the UNs peace plan being presented to both sides and immediately rejected by the pro-Saudi officials. Huge civilian death tolls in recent Saudi attacks have added up to make the US a bit more gunshy than usual about supporting the Saudi war publicly. \nAt the same time, the US opposition to the air war is slim indeed, with the US Ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, insisting even in the announcement of their opposition to further strikes that the US supports Saudi Arabias right to self-defense, which in this case included an outright invasion of a neighboring country. \nThe US has insisted Saudi aid is under review since a recent attack on a funeral. That said, there is no sign that any real changes in US policy were made, and the expectation is that, as always, US interest in growing arms exports will win out.","label":1,"_deepnote_index_column":20716},{"id":20717,"title":"US Airstrike Kills Four Iraqi Troops Near Mosul","author":"Jason Ditz","text":"Nine Others Wounded in 'Friendly Fire' Attack by Jason Ditz, October 29, 2016 Share This \nAs Iraqi forces continue to struggle to get closer to the ISIS city of Mosul during the ongoing invasion, a US friendly fire incident has been reported in the town of Tal-Kayf, a town which fell quite some time ago and in which recent fighting hadnt been reported. \nAccording to Iraqi military officials, the US airstrikes against the town killed at least four Iraqi soldiers and wounded nine others . The details are still scant on what happened, and the US has yet to comment on the incident at all. \nIraqi officials are chalking it up as a mistake, but it is unclear why the town would be struck by US planes in the first place, as the Iraqi troops had been there for almost a week and there did not appear to be ISIS forces in the immediate vicinity. \nIraqi forces confirmed the incident amid an announcement of more villages captured in the area west of Mosul. Many of the villages more than 5 km from the city have already fallen, and ISIS appears to be only sparsely defending those that remain, with the vast majority of their fighters hunkered down in Mosul itself, prepared for a major battle.

Barack Obamas image of himself is not accurate  to Americans, Obama is a reality TV show star.

It is therefore wrong that many others who wish to come to America can just walk across a border, and were encouraged to do so under the Obama administration. \nTrump has already outlined a plan to deport 2-3 million illegals who arrived illegally from South American countries and who pose a serious danger to the populace. The deportation of illegals with criminal records and links to gangs will be a first step, however there are still approximately 12 million known illegal aliens residing within the U.S.s border, and these will be rounded up and deported in the next year or so. \nThe logistics of rounding up these people and putting them on secure buses back to the border will be enormous. Some advisers are saying that there will be elements who try and flee from immigration control officers, however, they will have no place to go. They will not be able to work, or rent out a place to sleep, once they are caught they too will be rounded up and thrown out of the country. \nMany illegal immigrants are now going underground or fleeing back across the border, so Trump has a big job in front of him, that is if he does not go back on his word.

Even as she mourned the death of her    husband from a rare genetic disorder, Sarah Robertson was comforted by knowing that six vials of his sperm were safely stored at the Reproductive Fertility Center     in Tank B, Canister 5, Cane G, Position 6, Color Blue     waiting until she was ready to have the baby they had both longed for. But 10 years later, when she was ready to use the sperm from her husband, Aaron, she got devastating news. All six vials were missing. Id been completely focused on having something of Aarons live on, and now there was nothing, said Ms. Robertson in an interview at her   home in Montecito. Now she and her   are suing the Los Angeles clinic, and its owner, Dr. Peyman Saadat, accusing them of negligence, fraud, breach of contract and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The suit, filed in May, also says the clinic misappropriated Mr. Robertsons sperm     which had a 50 percent chance of carrying Marfan syndrome, the disorder that killed him     and used it to supply other patients who would not know to undergo testing to ensure their babies did not inherit the disorder. The Robertsons case is part of a new wave of lawsuits against sperm banks, highlighting claims of deception and negligence, and adding an array of challenges beyond the longstanding issue of undetected genetic problems. Dr. Saadat declined to be interviewed, but denied the accusations in a statement. Frozen sperm has become a major industry, dominated by a few large sperm banks, but with smaller stocks of sperm maintained at hundreds of   centers nationwide. The Food and Drug Administration requires that donor sperm be tested for infectious diseases. Beyond that, sperm banks are lightly regulated. Several states require health department licensing of the labs, but only New York conducts routine inspections. Some of the new cases accuse sperm banks of careless   or mishandling or misappropriation of sperm banked for a clients personal use. Others say the banks use hyped, misleading descriptions to market their donors. Several cases accuse a Georgia facility of marketing sperm as belonging to a neuroscientist with a   I. Q. who turned out to be a schizophrenic felon, and who has fathered at least 36 children. Even in New York, when they inspect, theyre looking at hygienic conditions not  said Arthur Caplan, a bioethics professor at New York University. Nobody confirms that you have what you say you have.  Its absurd that we have these materials so valuable that people pay to store them, but we run it like a   grocery, he continued. Cryopreservation has historically operated in a casual   environment, where people were just supposed to trust.  Sperm banks are not required to verify the information provided by donors, and lawyers familiar with the industry say many do not. They set their own limits on how many children a donor can sire, but unless the mothers voluntarily report the births, they may not know how many   are out there. Some, including the two largest, California Cryobank in Los Angeles and Fairfax Cryobank, headquartered in Virginia, test for many genetic conditions, while others test for very few. So it is       for people banking their own sperm for personal use after cancer treatment, and for those relying on a sperm banks description of an anonymous donor. Sean Tipton, a spokesman for the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, said his group did not see a need for further regulation and believed that the industry was generally reliable. All indications are that sperm donation has been a terrific way to help people start a family even if, as with anything that involves humans, there are mistakes and some    actors, he said. In the past, few problems with sperm came to light, because most families were unwilling to discuss such an intimate matter in public. But that is changing, with a demographic shift in sperm buyers. Once, sperm banks mostly served heterosexual married couples in which the husband had a fertility problem, but today about   of the buyers are either lesbian couples and single women, who are more open about their childrens origins. With genetic testing widely available and relatively cheap, the concept of donor anonymity is increasingly open to question. I can personally attest that there are more cases than you ever hear about, but almost all settle before they get to court, said Andrew Vorzimer, a California fertility lawyer representing the Robertsons. Wendy Kramer,   of the Donor Sibling Registry, which helps families connect with others who used the same donor, says she hears a steady stream of problems, including lost records and genetic issues reported to the sperm bank but never shared with all the donors offspring. People think its a medical industry, it must be regulated and trustworthy, but its just sperm sellers, said Ms. Kramer, whose registry, founded in 2000, has more than 50, 000 members, and has connected more than 13, 000 relatives. They can say whatever they want.  In Florida, California, Canada and England, lawsuits are pending against Xytex, the Georgia facility that sold sperm from Donor 9623, James Christian Aggeles. The lawsuit claims the sperm bank described Mr. Aggeles as a   neuroscientist with bachelors and masters degrees who was pursuing a Ph. D. in neuroscience engineering. Instead, according to court papers, Mr. Aggeles did not have a college degree, had a history of psychiatric hospitalizations and had an arrest record that included burglary. Many of the families that used Mr. Aggeless sperm had already found each other before Xytex sent an email that accidentally included his email address, prompting intense internet sleuthing by the mothers to discover his identity. We found out a lot of things about him from public information, said Angie Collins, an Ontario woman with a    son fathered by Mr. Aggeles. Xytex could have done that, too, if theyd wanted to. I think sperm banks should be required to get the donors medical records, and run a criminal background check.  Xytex would not discuss the case but Ted Lavender, a lawyer for the company, said in a statement that Xytex complies with all industry standards.  Jennifer Cramblett, a white Ohio mother who mistakenly got sperm from a black donor, is suing the Midwest Sperm Bank in Downers Grove, Ill. on the grounds of negligence. She and her partner had been sent vials from Donor 330, an   donor, rather than Donor 380, the white donor they had chosen, according to her lawsuit. No one at the Midwest Sperm Bank would discuss the case. Dr. Saadat, who was sued by Ms. Robertson, also faces a suit by Justin Hollman, a California man who froze five vials of his sperm before undergoing chemotherapy for testicular cancer at age 20. Years later, Mr. Hollman wanted his sperm transferred to his wifes fertility doctor. When he was presented with paperwork, his lawsuit says, he noticed that it authorized the destruction of his sperm instead of the transfer. After refusing to sign, the court papers say, Mr. Hollman got a call from Dr. Saadat later that day telling him the samples had been destroyed as a result of human error.  Mr. Hollman declined to discuss the case, and repeated calls to Dr. Saadats center and to his lawyers were not returned. The Robertsons lawsuit also claims there was deception by the center, which on different occasions said the sperm either had never been stored there or had been destroyed in a fire. When Ms. Robertson initially asked for the sperm, according to court papers, the center told her that five of the six vials were missing. The complaint went on to say that Dr. Saadat urged her to try to get pregnant with the sixth vial, but the clinics manager later emailed that the sixth vial, too, was gone. When I got that email, I stood up and screamed, said Ms. Robertson, who is a nurse practitioner. The Robertsons still wonder what sperm Dr. Saadat would have used if Ms. Robertson had agreed to use the purported last vial to get pregnant. Was he just going to take someones sample at random? Ms. Robertson asked. Its terrifying to imagine a health care business being operated so recklessly.

ObamaCare was designed to crush you in costs, points out the Conservative Treehouse blog . His comments shouldnt come as much of a surprise given what Gruber thinks of the American people.

[The House and Senate Intelligence committees should investigate what she did and why, the Wall Street Journal argued in an April 28 piece.  Last month, blogger Mike Cernovich and other news outlets reported that Rice had unmasked, or identified the names, of Trump campaign officials caught up during surveillance of a foreign target. The piece said Democrats raised a fuss in 2005 over   Bush official John Bolton doing the same thing but with far more justification, due to the job he held, but are now going all in to squelch the story. Then Senators Joe Biden and Chris Dodd kicked up a fuss that, as Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, Mr. Bolton had 10 times over four years asked for the names of American officials who were swept up in National Security Agency monitoring.  Democrats and their press allies are going all in to squelch the Susan Rice unmasking story, insisting that the decision by Barack Obamas national security adviser to seek the name of at least one Trump campaign official was routine and no big deal, it said. For example, it said, House Intelligence Committee Democrat Adam Schiff released a tutorial on why unmasking is lawful. Susan Rice Did Nothing Wrong, said an NBC headline, quoting no one on the record.  The Wall Street Journal editorial also pointed out that while Rice and Democrats have defended her actions as not uncommon, Democrats and the media in 2005 characterized it as unusual. At that time, Dodd claimed unmasking was rarely requested and infrequently by political appointees such as Mr. Bolton.  The New York Times also reported that requests to unmask are not common, particularly from policy makers.  The editorial also argued that there was no apparent reason for Rice to have requested the unmasking of Trump campaign officials names, contrary to her explanations. Ms. Rice had no direct intelligence duties in her NSC post, and no Democrat has provided a valid reason that Ms. Rice might have needed to unmask anyone associated with the Trump presidential campaign, the editorial said. Rice has denied doing anything untoward with the intelligence she received, as did Bolton. But Democrats had drawn up a list of 36 individuals that he clashed with and called on National Intelligence Director John Negroponte to rule out they were the target of Boltons unmasking. And while House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes ( ) has stepped aside from his committees Russia probe after complaints from   activist groups that he discussed unmasking in public, Democrats in 2005 couldnt stop talking to the press, the piece said. The piece also pointed out that names unmasked by Bolton have still never made it out to the public, in contrast with the illegal leaking in February of phone conversations held by former Trump National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Twelve years on, not one of the 10 individuals unmasked by Mr. Bolton has had his or her identity leaked. By contrast, the Washington Post reports that no fewer than nine Obama appointees or career officials leaked or confirmed the identity and conversations of unmasked former Trump adviser Michael Flynn. If John Boltons unmasking was questionable, then Mrs. Rices was more so. The House and Senate Intelligence committees should investigate what she did and why.  Rice is expected to be among witnesses asked by the House intelligence committee to testify in its ongoing probe of Russian interference in the elections.","label":0,"_deepnote_index_column":20723},{"id":20724,"title":"Lessons in the Delicate Art of Confronting Offensive Speech - The New York Times","author":"Benedict Carey and Jan Hoffman","text":"What if Billy Bush had just changed the subject? As unlikely as that may sound to anyone who has heard the infamous 2005 tape of Donald J. Trump boasting about sexually accosting women to the chuckling encouragement of Mr. Bush, an Access Hollywood host at the time, it just might have stifled the celebrity billionaire. A body of psychological research shows that even mild pushback against offensive remarks can have an instant effect     as difficult as that can be, especially with a boss, a friend or a celebrity. It is research worth considering in a political season when ethnic, racist and sexual slurs, not to mention general insults, seem to have become part of everyday chatter. Polls show that people are increasingly unhappy with the tenor of the national debate but unsure what to do about the decline in civility. Researchers have detailed the difficulty of confronting prejudice, but they have also found that even the politest of objections     or subtle corrections to loaded words     can almost instantly curb a speakers behavior. With a clearer understanding of the dynamics of such confrontation, psychologists say, people can develop tactics that can shut down the unsavory talk without ruining relationships, even when the offender has more status or power: a fraternity president, say, or a team captain or employer. The alternative is passive complicity, psychologists say. When we hear this egregious, uncomfortable talk and we dont speak up, whats actually happening is that the person speaking is getting a green light, said Sharyn J. Potter,   of the Prevention Innovations Research Center, at the University of New Hampshire. It encourages them.  It hardly takes a psychologist to explain the difficulty inherent in any such confrontation. Simply saying, I dont appreciate that comment, or Thats not cool     well, people arent going to like you very much after that, said Linda Tropp, a professor of psychology at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. But they do get defensive, and change their behavior quickly.  It is important to realize that you dont have to make a dramatic, principled stand. We dont want bystanders to think they have to fly in with their Superman cape, said Dr. Potter, who is also an associate professor of sociology. There are many approaches people can use to stop talk they find noxious, say experts in what is known as bystander education. Among them: distraction, such as abruptly changing the subject. Even in the locker room, guys can change the conversation, they can spray people with water, or crank up the music, Dr. Potter said. Rather than calling out the speaker and shaming him or her publicly, which can carry the risk of retaliation, you could make it about you. You could say: This is bothering me. One of my good friends was raped.  Dr. Potter said. If you put it on yourself, that might feel safer.  Or you can try humor. Gail Stern, an educator and a   of Catharsis Productions, which gives sexual violence prevention training on college campuses and in the military, said that one deft approach might be to assume that the speaker is being outrageous on purpose, and to respond with something like this: I love satire. Its so weird that people believe that for real and its so cool you called that out.  She calls that tactic verbal aikido, after the Japanese martial art whose practitioners defend themselves by redirecting an opponents attack. An essential component of bystander intervention training is to get participants to imagine their own responses to scenarios. The goal is to get people to arm themselves with approaches that feel natural and innate, rather than outfitting them with model scripts. If you have a plan in your head, then you can use it, Dr. Potter said. Psychologists who study the effects of such confrontation divide offensive behavior into two loose categories. One includes strangers acting out     a mother who slaps a toddler, a boy who punches his girlfriend     and bystanders, when they react, tend to do so viscerally and quickly. The other category includes offensive jokes or references among people who know one another, like friends or  . In those cases, there are more gray areas, as well as personality factors to consider and often a relationship at stake. Objections, if they come, often take a little longer than bystander intervention does. Deborah Cameron, a professor of language and communication at the University of Oxford, said that sexual banter often takes place among men who are friends, and that the function of it is to promote bonding.  Men may feel that if they challenge conversation they find tasteless, or simply dont join in, theyre spoiling the mood at a minimum and possibly putting their relationship to the group at risk, she said. And sometimes they worry that it will raise doubts about their masculinity or heterosexuality, or that they will become targets of bullying, said Ms. Cameron, author of The Myth of Mars and Venus: Do Men and Women Really Speak Different Languages? Yet subtle objections can stop people in midsentence, in some cases prompting later reflection, psychologists have found. In one type of experiment, for example, study participants guess the occupations of people based on a photograph and limited information, like spends most of his days walking the streets or does regular housework.  Most of these profiles are ethnically neutral. But some are ringers. The photo of a black man who walks the streets often prompts guesses of homeless rather than mail carrier and a black woman who depends on money from the government gets identified as a welfare mom instead of a government employee or a student with loans. Then the researchers, under the guise of fellow participants, push back. We confront them in a variety of ways, sometimes harshly     Thats racist!     and sometimes much less so, appealing to equality: Shouldnt everyone be treated the same?  said Alexander Czopp, director of the Center for   Research at Western Washington University. Depending on how the confrontation is done, the participants might show different levels of defensiveness and anger right away but they usually show less   attitudes on tests we do later.  David Fleischer, director of the Los Angeles LGBT Centers Leadership Lab, often sends gay and transgender people into socially conservative districts to do    canvassing. We have to handle these situations all the time, said Mr. Fleischer, now canvassing in Cleveland. We are seeking out people who are prejudiced, and theyre using offensive language. And if you correct that language, just use different words yourself, and your tone and demeanor are kind, people are very responsive, and you dont have to get into a screaming match.  In a recent study, Mr. Fleischer and other researchers found that this kind of canvassing can soften the views of some 10 percent of voters     a large shift when it comes to political behavior, and one that has prompted wider training in such cordial, respectful correcting of language. Of course, most people never get any training they make judgments on the fly, about costs, tactics and personal integrity. And some are more likely to speak up than others, new research suggests. Aneeta Rattan, an assistant professor of organizational behavior at the London Business School and Carol Dweck of Stanford found in a recent study that people who are optimistic and believe that others can change     that a bigot, with time, can change stripes     are more likely than the pessimists to say something. In that sense, Dr. Rattan said, this work suggests that your belief system about others can either be a barrier or a staircase where you can take that first step     even if its just saying, I disagree.

But even on the putting green, I was taking a few easy swings and my back was so tight. I was only swinging 80 percent and I couldnt get through the ball all the way. The backswing was fine but at impact and moving through, it hurt. I knew I wasnt going to be able to compete. Its terribly disappointing On a windy day, Charley Hoffman used nine birdies to surge to the top of the leader board with a    65. He has a   lead over William McGirt, who is playing his first Masters at age 37. Lee Westwood is at   and Phil Mickelson, Sergio Garcia and Justin Rose are part of an   group that is  . Johnson had an extended   session before his tee time just after 2 p. m. He hit dozens of balls on the practice range but also took numerous breaks to go inside at the Augusta National Golf Club to have work done on his back. Nonetheless, about five minutes before his tee time, he began walking toward the first tee and practice putting green. Its really too bad     it feels like in two days Ill be fine, Johnson said, standing alongside the first tee after his withdrawal. Johnson offered a few more details about the mishap at his rented home in the Augusta area. He said his son, Tatum, was on his way back from day care, and he was going to move the car. I slipped down the stairs, and there were only three stairs, Johnson said. It would have been better if it was a full staircase because I might have slid more. Instead, I just kind of stopped and hit.  He landed on his elbow and lower back. He said the elbow was swollen but did not inhibit his swing. His back remained a problem even after he had medical personnel treat it for hours on Wednesday night. I was up all night and didnt really sleep, said Johnson, last years United States Open champion. It got better, but not really better enough.  Before the fall, Johnsons coach, Butch Harmon, who is doing commentary for   Sky Sports, suggested on the air that this Masters was Johnsons to lose. Hes probably playing the best he has ever played in his life, Harmon said. He absolutely loves this place and finished fourth here last year so has to be the   favorite. But that means nothing once Thursday starts.  Johnson, 32, who supplanted Jason Day at No. 1 in February, arrived here with victories in his last three starts. He was the pretournament consensus favorite to become the first player since Jimmy Demaret in 1940 to make the Masters his fourth consecutive P. G. A. Tour win. On Tuesday, Johnson was asked about going into the Masters as the favorite. His response foreshadowed this unexpected turn of events. Ive got a lot of confidence in my game right now, especially with the way Ive been playing the last few tournaments, he said. But, you know, anything can happen.  This is the second time in the past six years that an injury kept Johnson from competing in the Masters, which is about a   drive from Columbia, S. C. where he was born. In 2012, Johnson withdrew two days before the first round with a back injury, which he said he got from lifting a Jet Ski. Fred Couples, whose World Golf Hall of Fame career has been disrupted by chronic back issues, said he was disappointed to hear that Johnson hadnt been able to start. Its a bummer, he said, adding, But I didnt fall down any stairs. Maybe that would have helped my back.  Follow the Masters leader board here.

[The judges cry of outrage came when he could not block the orderly repatriation of an illegal immigrant who has two drunk driving convictions, plus a U. S. wife and three children.   We are unable to prevent [Andres] Magana Ortizs removal, yet it is contrary to the values of this nation and its legal system, complained Judge Stephen Reinhardt, who wishes to extend citizens rights to illegal foreign migrants. He said:  We are compelled to deny Mr. Magana Ortizs request for a stay of removal because we do not have the authority to grant it. We are not, however, compelled to find the governments action in this case fair or just.         The governments decision to remove Magana Ortiz diminishes not only our country but our courts, which are supposedly dedicated to the pursuit of justice. Magana Ortiz and his family are in truth not the only victims. Among the others are judges who, forced to participate in such inhumane acts, suffer a loss of dignity and humanity as well. I concur as a judge, but as a citizen I do not. The judge, who was appointed     not elected     in 1980 and is married to a former top leader in the ACLU, also lamented the authority of ordinary DHS agents to enforce the law despite protests from     civil rights lawyers: On January 25, 2017, the President [Donald Trump] signed a series of executive orders dismantling the system of priorities that had previously guided Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol in determining whom to deport. The orders also gave far greater authority to individual agents and officers, who are now removing   simply because they are here illegally, regardless of whether they have committed any offense. In light of the breadth of these orders and the lack of any apparent limit on agents discretion, the undocumented must now choose between going to work, school, hospitals, and even court, and the risk of being seized.  In contrast, the new Supreme Court Justice appointed by Trump, Neil Gorsuch, has a more humble vision of his job as a judicial referee, saying in a 2013 award ceremony that: As my daughters remind me, donning a [judicial] robe doesnt make me any smarter        It serves as a reminder of whats expected of us   what [Irish philosopher Edmund] Burke called the cold neutrality of an impartial judge.  It serves, too, as a reminder of the relatively modest station were meant to occupy in a democratic society. In other places, judges wear scarlet and ermine. Here, were told to buy our own plain black robes     and I can attest the standard choir outfit at the local uniform supply store is a good deal. Ours is a judiciary of honest black polyester. The judges on Reinhardts Ninth Circuit are expected to release soon a decision blocking Trumps Executive Orders limiting the entry of people from six   Muslim countries. The decision is based on a Hawaiian case, in which an   Islamic cleric claimed his constitutional rights were infringed by Trumps efforts to reduce Islamic jihad in the United States. The courts decision may have been delayed by the   bloody attacks in Manchester and London, at least one of which was conducted by the sons of Muslim refugees and migrants from Libya.  Reinhardts intemperate language, said Andrew Arthur, a former immigration judge, suggests that the courts decisions are political biased. There is no cold neutrality in the Ninth Circuits ruling, Arthur wrote about the courts preliminary ruling in the Hawaii case. It is personal, visceral, and vindictive.

We should not be focusing on Syria,\" Trump told Reuters on Tuesday morning at his resort in Doral, Florida. \"You're going to end up in World War III over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton.\" The Republican nominee, who has called for a rapprochement with Russia in order to jointly combat ISIS, argued that his Democratic rival's calls for taking a more aggressive posture in Syria to bring the conflict there to an end and combat ISIS will only draw the US into a larger war. Trump's remarks come as he trails Clinton in most national and key battleground state polls just two weeks from Election Day. \"You're not fighting Syria anymore, you're fighting Syria, Russia and Iran, all right? Russia is a nuclear country, but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk,\" he said. Trump: I'd 'love' to fight Biden Trump has not laid out a clear strategy for combating ISIS or addressing the globally destabilizing conflict in Syria, which has killed hundreds of thousands and pushed millions more to flee their homes. He has suggested the US should allow ISIS, anti-government rebels and the Syrian government to fight it out and more recently has focused on joining forces with Russia -- which has aided the Syrian regime in the bombing of civilians and US-allied rebels -- to combat ISIS. \"Assad is secondary, to me, to ISIS,\" Trump told Reuters of the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, whom US officials have argued must step down. Clinton has called for establishing a no-fly zone over Syria to help bring the five-year civil war to an end, a proposal top Republicans in Congress have championed, which President Barack Obama and others have opposed due to the risk of entering into conflict with Russia. A US-enforced no-fly zone would mean the US could shoot down a Russian jet should it enter Syrian airspace. Clinton addressed those concerns in the final presidential debate, arguing that it would \"save lives and hasten the end of the conflict,\" while cautioning that \"this would not be done just on the first day.\" \"This would take a lot of negotiation and it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose is to provide safe zones on the ground,\" Clinton said during the debate earlier this month. \"I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and Syrians that this was something that we believe the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria. It would help us in the fight against ISIS.\" Trump has additionally called for establishing safe zones in Syria to protect civilians -- as has Clinton -- which could also put the US in conflict with the Syrian government or Russia should they oppose the policy. The Clinton campaign later Tuesday pushed back against Trump's rhetoric. \"National security experts on both sides of the aisle have denounced Donald Trump as dangerously ill-prepared and temperamentally unfit to serve as commander-in-chief,\" Clinton spokesman Jesse Lehrich said. \"Once again, he is parroting Putin's talking points and playing to Americans' fears, all while refusing to lay out any plans of his own for defeating ISIS or alleviating humanitarian suffering in Syria. Moreover, this incendiary attack is aimed at a policy that his own running mate, Mike Pence, strongly supports.\" Poll: Most see a Hillary Clinton victory and a fair count ahead While Clinton has accused Trump of being Putin's \"puppet,\" Trump knocked Clinton for her criticism of the Russian strongman, asking, \"How she is going to go back and negotiate with this man who she has made to be so evil.\" And just two days after he tied the successful enactment of his agenda as president to the election of Republican majorities in Congress, Trump also returned to his more typical complaints of a lack of Republican unity weighing down his candidacy. \"If we had party unity, we couldn't lose this election to Hillary Clinton,\" he told Reuters. That complaint didn't put Trump in more of a bipartisan mood, though, as the Republican nominee also told Reuters he would not consider putting any Democrats in his cabinet -- a departure from recent presidents, who have sought to post at least one member of their rival party in a top administration post.","label":1,"_deepnote_index_column":20728},{"id":20729,"title":"Shock Video: Gunman Ambushes Police Inside Arizona Walmart","author":"Warner Todd Huston","text":"Shocking surveillance video of two police officers ambushed by a gunman inside an Arizona Walmart has been release.

It has been called a diplomatic graveyard, having frustrated generations of negotiators. It has been compared     in complexity and duration, not bloodshed     to the   conflict. Cyprus has effectively been partitioned since 1974, its Greek and Turkish communities     and its capital, Nicosia     separated by a buffer zone known as the Green Line. But unlike most conflict zones, Cyprus is more or less at peace, and a popular tourist destination. Hundreds of thousands of people have crossed the line since travel restrictions were eased in 2003. The following year, the country joined the European Union. So why has the conflict defied so many efforts at resolution? The answer has as much to do with domestic politics on both sides of the island as with pressures from Turkey and Greece as well as Britain, the   ruler of Cyprus, James   a scholar at the London School of Economics and the author of several books on the Cyprus conflict, said in a phone interview. On Monday, the Greek Cypriot leader, Nicos Anastasiades, and the Turkish Cypriot leader, Mustafa Akinci, began five days of talks brokered by the United Nations at Mont Plerin, a Swiss resort. The secretary general, Ban   urged them to do their utmost in order to reach a settlement within 2016, and said the prospect of a solution in Cyprus is within their reach.  Such hopes have been dashed before. In 2004, the Greek Cypriot community rejected a peace plan brokered by Mr. Bans predecessor, Kofi Annan. Society just wasnt ready for a deal, Mr.   said. What were seeing now, though, is that the two leaders are much more aligned. The question is whether they can bring their communities along with them.  Some answers to basic questions about the conflict: Cyprus has 1. 1 million inhabitants, about the same as Rhode Island, but in an area around three and a half times the size. About 78 percent are Greek Cypriots (most of them Orthodox Christians) and about 18 percent are Turkish Cypriots (most of them Sunni Muslims). The country has three officially recognized Christian minorities     Maronites, Latins (Roman Catholics) and Armenians     and a small Roma, or Gypsy, community. The internationally recognized government of the Republic of Cyprus controls only the southern   of it. The remaining third is the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, recognized only by Turkey. Cyprus came under British control in the late 19th century, during the decline of the Ottoman Empire. Many Greek Cypriots supported the political union of all Greeks living under Turkish rule within a sovereign Greek nation, while many Turkish Cypriots favored a partition of the island between Greece and Turkey. In the late 1950s, a guerrilla group, the National Organization of Cypriot Fighters, rebelled against British rule. As Cyprus slid toward war, the United States and Britain feared that the conflict could open the door to Soviet dominance in the eastern Mediterranean. Archbishop Makarios, the longtime Greek Cypriot leader, agreed to independence as an alternative to union with Greece. The new countrys Constitution, ratified on Aug. 16, 1960, provided for a Greek Cypriot president, a Turkish Cypriot vice president, and a Civil Service 70 percent Greek Cypriot and 30 percent Turkish Cypriot. Britain, Greece and Turkey pledged to maintain the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Cyprus, and Britain kept two sizable military bases there. But after Archbishop Makarios, as president, proposed amendments to the Constitution, fighting between the two communities broke out. Turkish Cypriots say their side was expelled from the government Greek Cypriots say Turkish Cypriots left the government to form a parallel administration. The pivotal year was 1974. That summer, the leader of Greeces military junta, which controlled a guerrilla group in Cyprus, ousted Archbishop Makarios, who went into exile. Turkish officials believed that a Cypriot union with Greece was imminent. In July, Turkey invaded to protect Turkish Cypriots. The junta in Greece collapsed, but during peace talks Turkey sent in a second wave of troops in August, overrunning the north. Turkish settlers also descended on the north, while about 160, 000 Greek Cypriots were displaced. Over the years, support for political union with Greece has dissipated. Since the late 1970s, leaders on both sides have agreed in principle on a bizonal, bicommunal federation as the basis for reunification, but have different understandings of that term. The disagreements affect key issues, including the return of displaced Cypriots and the handling of their property, repatriation of Turkish settlers, demilitarization of the island and the future role of Greece, Turkey and Britain. For most Greek Cypriots, a new federation means two tightly linked federal units, neither defined mainly in ethnic terms for many Turkish Cypriots, maintaining control over a strongly autonomous region is key. Land is also a key issue. Turkish Cypriots control 36 percent of the islands area, and by most estimates, that proportion will decline to between 26 percent and 29 percent under any lasting peace deal. But the percentage is in dispute, as is where to draw the boundaries. Mr. Annan, the previous secretary general, proposed a   plan, along with a compromise on former Greek Cypriot property. The plan also allowed a limited right of return for displaced members of both communities, and gradual reductions of Greek and Turkish troops. Momentum for the deal was considerable. In 2003, the Turkish Cypriot authorities relaxed travel restrictions, and within two weeks, 200, 000 people had crossed the Green Line. Turkeys new prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, supported the talks. One major incentive was the Republic of Cypruss candidacy for membership in the European Union. But in April 2004, a week before the country formally joined the European Union, Greek Cypriots rejected the deal in a referendum, while Turkish Cypriots voters approved it. The two leaders are fairly new     Mr. Anastasiades, a lawyer, took office in 2013, and Mr. Akinci, an architect, last year     and seem open to compromise. Unlike past Turkish leaders, Mr. Erdogan is not seen as being personally invested in Cyprus the Greek government, for its part, is dealing with a lingering economic crisis. The legal landscape has shifted. The European Court of Human Rights opened the way for lawsuits from Greek Cypriots who lost property by one reading, even ordinary tourists to the north could potentially face fines for staying at hotels or eating on restaurants built on Greek Cypriot land. That could have a potentially disastrous economic impact in the north. Putting pressure on the Turkish Cypriots, they may soon be outnumbered by the settlers who arrived after the 1974 invasions, and their descendants. The pressure on the Greek Cypriots to negotiate is less clear. While some now believe a de facto partition is permanent, the mainstream view is that reunification is the best outcome, although substantial disagreements remain over what it should look like.","label":0,"_deepnote_index_column":20730},{"id":20731,"title":"PICS: Thousands March Through London in Last Anti-Brexit Protest before Article 50","author":"Nick Hallett","text":"Several thousand people on Saturday joined the last   protest to take place before Britain formally begins the process of leaving the European Union.

The PR firm was tasked with promoting what the Pentagon called democratic elections in Iraq, ultimately earning over a hundred million dollars yearly. Part of the firms job included producing  fake al Qaeda propaganda films,  the Bureau of Investigative Journalism recently reported . \nDespite the PR operations hefty price tag, the Pentagon seemed to have no issue allocating taxpayer resources to have these videos produced. But over ten years after the Iraq invasion, the Pentagon is now concerned about its past appropriations  at least part of them, anyway. \nTen years after promising $15,000 bonuses to soldiers willing to re-enlist in 2006 and 2007, the Pentagon is now forcing California veterans to pay the bonuses back. \n\nIn California, the Los Angeles Times reports ,  officials signed up soldiers in assembly-line fashion  in 2006 and 2007, outlining the  generous terms available for six-year reenlistments  to those willing to sacrifice their safety, leaving their homes, once again, to fight abroad in exchange for a large bonus. Now, the Pentagon wants their money back. \nTo Get Soldiers to Re-enlist, the National Guard Lied \nIn 2008, the movie  Stop-Loss  highlighted a reality few members of the public were informed about. \nWith the growing involvement of U.S. military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, soldiers who had already served in Iraq and Afghanistan for several tours were being asked to reenlist. Sometimes, these soldiers term duties were extended forcefully via the governments controversial stop-loss policy , which allows the government to extend the period a soldier must spend on active duty involuntarily. \nIn California, the states National Guard began promising thousands of soldiers that they would receive $15,000 bonuses for going back to war. \nNow, nearly 10,000 soldiers who took the National Guards promise at face value are being ordered to pay the bonuses back plus interest charges. In some cases, their wages are being garnished to fund the payments. \nThis issue was first brought up when veterans  whose only mistake was to accept bonuses offered when the Pentagon needed to fill the ranks  were the target of an investigation launched in 2010. \nAfter receiving reports of improper payments, a federal probe found  thousands of bonuses and student loan payments were given to California Guard soldiers who did not qualify for them, or were approved despite paperwork errors.  \nAs a result of the investigation, Army Master Sgt. Toni Jaffe, who also served as the California Guards incentive manager, pleaded guilty to filing false claims totaling $15.2 million in 2011. He was sentenced to spend 30 months in federal prison, and three other officers who also pleaded guilty to fraud were put on probation. \nBreaking the National Guards promise to soldiers whose reenlistment depended on the bonus distribution, the California Guard  assigned 42 auditors to comb through paperwork for bonuses and other incentive payments given to 14,000 soldiers.  \nIn September 2016, these auditors finalized the investigation, finding roughly 9,700 current and retired soldiers who had been given  improper  bonuses. These soldiers have been told to repay some or all of their bonuses since the probe was launched and the first cases were discovered. \nAccording to the California National Guard, these repayments have recovered more than $22 million so far, compromising veterans like Robert Richmond, who now works for a construction company in Texas. He was an Army Sergeant First Class living in Huntington Beach when in 2006, he was asked to reenlist. \n I signed a contract that I literally risked my life to fulfill,  Richmond explained, adding that he only agreed to go back to war because he was told he qualified for a $15,000 bonus as a special forces soldier. \nThe veteran had gone through a divorce after being deployed to Afghanistan in 2002 and 2003. Asked to consider the bonus to reenlist, Richmond thought the money was going to give him  breathing room,  so he agreed. In 2007, he was sent to Iraqs  Triangle of Death,  an area a few miles south of Baghdad known for intense fighting. \nIn one of the hundreds of missions against insurgents he was a part of, Richmond sustained permanent back and brain injuries after his vehicle triggered a roadside bomb. \nIn 2014, the California Guard headquarters contacted him, letting the former special forces soldier know he was being urged to repay the $15,000 bonus he received in 2006. If he failed to make the payment, the letter said, he would face  debt collection action.  \nRichmond refused to give the government any money back, filing appeal after appeal.  [Impacted soldiers] want somebody in the government, anybody, to say this is wrong and well stop going after this money,  he said. \nSupport the Troops!: Code for Dont Question War? \nIn Washington, D.C., lawmakers have condemned the Pentagon, saying the soldiers were not at fault for accepting a bonus they were promised. \nPromising to open an investigation into the enlistment bonus problem, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) called the Pentagons demands  disgraceful.  \n The Department of Defense should waive these repayments,  McCarthy said in a statement .  The House will investigate these reports to ensure our soldiers are fully honored for their service,  he added. \nRep. McCarthy says the government should not be demanding any money back from veterans in his statement. The California Republican and also argued that  we are the ones who owe a debt for the great sacrifices our heroes have made  some of whom unfortunately paid the ultimate sacrifice. ? \nInstead of using this opportunity to highlight the importance of safeguarding our soldiers and keeping them from engaging in unconstitutional wars that are only successfully sold to the American public because administrations lie , McCarthy celebrates these very soldiers sacrifices. \nUsing this discussion to repeat the traditional support the troops line, lawmakers like McCarthy steer the debate away from whats causing these soldiers so much pain and distress, acting as if relentless war hasnt been the reason they were lied to. Instead, McCarthy and others are pushing the government to keep its promise without reevaluating how the U.S. government goes about irresponsibly sending these men and women abroad to fight insurgents who didnt pose a threat to Americans at the time . \nIn the 1964 film,  The Americanization of Emily,  which was based on a novel written by a veteran who had been a SeaBee officer on D-Day, character Lt. Comdr. Charles E. Madison gives a short speech explaining that  [those] who make heroes of our dead and shrines of our battlefields  perpetuate war by exalting its sacrifices.  \nFailing to discuss the real costs of war with the American electorate while exalting the sacrifices made by those who serve in the military is part of an ongoing campaign  deliberate or otherwise  to keep America involved in perpetual war. \nDont believe me? Dont take my word for it. Instead, read what journalist Randolph Bourne had to say about the countrys thirst for war in 1918: \n In times of peace, we usually ignore the State in favour of partisan political controversies, or personal struggles for office, or the pursuit of party policies. It is the Government rather than the State with which the politically minded are concerned. The State is reduced to a shadowy emblem which comes to consciousness only on occasions of patriotic holiday.  \nWith the shock of war, however, the State comes into its own again. The Government, with no mandate from the people, without consultation of the people, conducts all the negotiations, the backing and filling, the menaces and explanations, which slowly bring it into collision with some other Government, and gently and irresistibly slides the country into war.  \nWar, Bourne concluded ,  is the health of the state.  This is not because all individuals involved with governing enjoy death and destruction per se, but because  it is  in war that the urgency for union seems greatest, and the necessity for universality seems most unquestioned,  which forces the public to unite behind the state no matter what  especially if the occasion leading to war is  terrifying  the public. \nWhile veterans whose bonuses are being questioned ten years later should be heard and protected from government abuse, we must not forget it was governments own thirst for war that initiated this cycle of deception. Let us not ignore the reasons why we should support our troops  and how we should go about it; simply claiming to be interested in celebrating U.S. soldiers for their sacrifice does nothing for them. \nBy Allice Salles / theAntiMedia.org The US Military Lied to Thousands of Soldiers  and Now Veterans Are Paying for It","label":1,"_deepnote_index_column":20732},{"id":20733,"title":"Donald Trump Tackles Totally Biased Today Show on NBC for Fake News - Breitbart","author":"Charlie Spiering","text":"  Donald Trump lashed out against NBCs Today show after they reported that the recent job announcements from major companies were already being created in the United States anyway.

(Photo by Tony Webster Flickr) \nThe effect on workers across the old industrial belts has been devastating. Millions have been pushed out of a middle-class lifestyle. They have seen their plants close and jobs shipped to cheap labor markets overseas. Or they have lost out to robotics. \nTheyve also seen the economy shift from production to financial speculation. And theyve seen the greatest transfer of wealth in decades to the obscenely rich. Wealthy liberals whove benefited from this shift often act as if they are morally superior to the systems losers who hear Hillary Clinton put them in a basket of deplorables. \nOn Tuesday, these downwardly mobile workers spoke out, giving Trump the votes he needed in the Rust Belt states of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin to put him over the top in the Electoral College (although Clinton appears headed toward a plurality of the votes nationally.) \nThat someone as eminently unqualified (at least in the traditional sense) could flip the electoral map in this way was stunning. But is the Democratic Party listening and can it adapt to reflect the interests of these Americans? The future of the party may depend on it. \nFor the past two decades, Democrats have relied on the support of these Rust Belt states as a bulwark for their national candidacies. These states voted twice for Barack Obama. \nBut many of these blue-collar workers were counting on a significant change to their circumstances, but Obama had failed to deliver that and Clinton only vaguely addressed their concerns with a variety of mostly small-bore policy ideas. Many of these voters judged that the Democrats couldnt or wouldnt deliver. So, they rudely slapped the party in the face. \nParallel political trends are playing out in Great Britain, where a discontented working class spearheaded the Brexit withdrawal from the European Union and where Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is fighting to dismantle Blairs so-called New Labour movement and trying to restore the Labour Partys historic ties to the working class. \nLast week , we learned in a leaked speech that Bill Clinton gave last year that he denigrated Corbyn, saying Labour went out and practically got a guy off the street to be the leader of the party. When people feel theyve been shafted and they dont expect anything to happen anyway, they just want the maddest person in the room to represent them. \nBill Clintons remarks were typical of the Democrats smugness and their contempt for ordinary people. So there was some satisfaction in seeing the humiliation of these careerist and corporatist Democrats on Tuesday. \nNow, the Democratic Party had better figure out how they can serve the interests of those blue-collar workers or the party can expect more of the same. So far they are blaming everyone and everthing for having created this workers backlash: sexism, the media, FBI Director James Comey (Clinton pinned it specifically on him), Vladimir Putin, Green Party candidate Jill Stein and even Clinton cheerleader Bernie Sanders (for poisoning the youth vote). \nA former Clinton operative speaking on Fox News said the day after an election loss is a time to engage in the blame game. He said everybody is being blamed but Secretary Clinton. \nPursuing Solutions \nThere are solutions to economic injustice but few in power pursue them because its not in their self-interest. And politicians of any party act primarily on self-interest these days, which usually translates into the interests of their wealthy financial backers and is thus inimical to real democracy. President Bill Clinton \nWithout a sharp turn to the left to regain workers support, the Democratic Party risks becoming totally irrelevant. A new batch of Democratic Party leaders committed to workers must emerge. They have four years to prepare. \nSenators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren tarnished themselves as leaders who can achieve this by supporting a center-right candidate in Hillary Clinton. They failed to acknowledge that Clinton was too alienated from many blue-collar workers (especially whites) who in the end abandoned the party to gamble on Trump. \nSanders, an independent who chose to run in the Democratic primaries, had been offered the top of the Green Party ticket. The partys   Jill Stein, who was willing to give up that spot, said he never answered her. Had they run together they might have gotten the 15 percent in the polls to enter the debates where Sanders would have been a lofty alternative to Clinton and Trump  though had Trump still won on Nov. 8, Sanders surely would have been denounced as a sore loser and blamed for dividing the anti-Trump vote. \nAs it turned out, the Democrats managed to lose the White House to Trump on their own. Though the Democratic leadership wont admit it, they now know that Sanders was running the right campaign to defend workers interests and would have been the right messenger to carry that message. However, to protect their own privileged class interests and those of their donors, establishment Democrats left the country open to the dangerous victory of Donald Trump. \nRust Belt working-class voters cant be blamed for the choices they were given. Without Sanders  and with the Democrats offering one more establishment candidate  these alienated voters instead sent a demagogue to the White House, clinging to the hope that he might keep some of his promises: to end ruinous trade deals, bring back manufacturing jobs to the U.S., create jobs by rebuilding the infrastructure, avoid new wars and clean the D.C. swamp of corruption. \nJudging by the people being mentioned for his Cabinet, its already looking dodgy: the usual cast of right-wing Republicans  the likes of Newt Gingrich and Rudy Giuliani  who have been part of the problem going back decades. \nYet, if Trump fails to fulfill his promises to improve the economy for common Americans, the voters he so skillfully riled up might well send him packing in 2020 unless, of course, the Democrats put up another corporate choice. \nThat leaves the notoriously difficult path for a third party that could represent the interests of ordinary Americans. But that possibility showed little traction in 2016, with marginal vote totals for both the Libertarian and Green parties. \nMedia Also Repudiated \nOn the positive side, this election became a repudiation not only of the Democratic Party insiders, but also of establishment Republicans, Wall Street, celebrity culture (with famous people flocking to Clinton) and the mainstream news media. The Pentagon, headquarters of the U.S. Defense Department, as viewed with the Potomac River and Washington, D.C., in the background. (Defense Department photo) \nThe shock to the American political system also is prompting admissions one would never have imagined hearing. On Fox News the morning after the election, a group of personalities (calling themselves journalists) were suddenly talking about class in America, a normally taboo subject. \nOne of them said journalists didnt understand this election because none of them know anyone who makes less than $60,000 a year. Apparently, these pampered performers dont even mix with many members of their own profession. I can introduce them to plenty of journalists making less than that, let alone Rust Belt workers. \nWill Rahn of CBS News accused the media of missing the story after having spent months mocking the people who had a better sense of what was going on. This is all symptomatic of modern journalisms great moral and intellectual failing: its unbearable smugness . \nRahn said working-class people have captured the imagination of journalists, who have come to talk about them like colonial administrators would talk about a primitive inland tribe that interferes with the construction of a jungle railway: They must be pacified until history kills them off. \nThese are stunning admissions that would never have happened without this election result. But one wonders how long such introspection in the corporate media will last. After the mainstream media got the Iraq WMD story wrong and contributed to the disastrous 2003 invasion, there were a few halfhearted mea culpas but very little accountability. \nFor instance, Washington Post editorial-page editor Fred Hiatt, who repeatedly wrote as flat fact that Iraq was hiding WMD and who mocked the few dissenting voices trying to warn Americans about the flimsiness of the evidence, is still the editorial-page editor of The Washington Post. \nSo, not surprisingly  with almost none of the star journalists suffering any career setbacks  the corporate media was soon joining more propaganda campaigns for more wars, which are mostly fought by young working-class men and women who actually do suffer. \nThe difference now is that this new political force of fed-up voters  who came out of nowhere as far as the Democrats and the media were concerned although these voters were staring them in the face  might now force a re-evaluation. Thats because these voters are likely still to be there four years from now. \nJoe Lauria is a veteran foreign-affairs journalist based at the U.N. since 1990.

Get to a theater! It works. Research indicates that Oscar nominations often result in tens of millions in additional ticket sales, particularly for     films. Among the movies counting on awards attention to find a bigger audience is Moonlight.  Seen as a leading contender for best picture, this euphorically reviewed drama about a young black man in Miami started strong but has stalled. It has taken in about $15. 8 million over 14 weeks. For Silence, Martin Scorsese and Paramount desperately need the academy to help their   drama from becoming a financial washout. Costing $50 million to make, Silence, a passion project for Mr. Scorsese as director, has collected $5. 2 million since its arrival on Dec. 23. Lion, a   set largely in India, is a Weinstein Company film that has earned $16. 4 million     a solid result for an art film of its type but still a long way from Weinstein awards hits in recent years. (Another Weinstein movie, The Founder, about the start of the McDonalds   empire, arrived to $3. 4 million in ticket sales over the weekend.) 20th Century Women, a comedic drama about a quirky mother (Annette Bening) in the late 1970s, has taken in $2. 3 million. An Oscar nomination for Ms. Bening would help give it momentum. As for the weekend, Split, the latest thriller from M. Night Shyamalan and Blumhouse Productions, was the No. 1 movie in North America. Expertly marketed by Universal Pictures, which leaned on   digital promotions, Split sold an estimated $40. 2 million in tickets, far surpassing prerelease analyst expectations. Split cost just $9 million to make, with Mr. Shyamalan personally footing the bill. Arriving as a distant second was XXX: The Return of Xander Cage (Paramount) which managed roughly $20 million     an underwhelming start for a film that cost at least $125 million to make and market and was designed to revive an action series that had been dormant for 12 years. Instead, The Return of Xander Cage, starring Vin Diesel, who tried to rally his 101 million Facebook followers, will likely become more evidence that Americans have little appetite for movie franchises that have been on ice for more than a few years. (See: Independence Day: Resurgence and Zoolander 2. ) Paramount, which offset its financial risk by bringing in partners, said the film collected an additional $50. 5 million in partial release overseas and called it the No. 1 movie in the world.  Rounding out the top three, Hidden Figures (20th Century Fox) continued to ride strong word of mouth, taking in roughly $16. 3 million, for a   domestic total of $84. 2 million, according to comScore, which compiles ticketing data.","label":0,"_deepnote_index_column":20736},{"id":20737,"title":"Treason: Clinton Sold State Secrets To Middle East Via Huma Abedin","author":"Sean Adl-Tabatabai","text":"Breitbart.com reports: \nLong-time political operative Roger Stone told Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon Wednesday of Hillary Clinton confidant Huma Abedin, Most of the experts Ive spoken to conclude, looking at the various facts regarding Humaher rise, where she came from, her family background, her various connectionsconclude that she is most likely a Saudi spy, which is my own conclusion. \nStone also discusses the clear, deep, inarguable, indisputable connections between Huma Abedin and a Saudi Arabian official named Abdullah Omar Naseef  one of the founders of the Muslim World League (MWL). . The MWL is directly tied to the Rabita Trust, a Specially Designated Global Terrorist Entity, which Stone previously discussed : Naseef, the Muslim World League, and the government of Pakistan created the Rabita Trust in 1988. Naseef was a sponsor and financial supporter of Syed Abedins IMMA. Just a month after the 9/11 jihadist attack left thousands dead and brought down the World Trade Center, President George W. Bushs Executive Order designated the Rabita Trust as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist Entity and the Treasury Department froze its assets on October 12, 2001. Naseef founded the Rabita Trust and remains involved with it to this day. A Treasury Department press release issued when Rabita Trusts assets were frozen indicated that Rabita Trust is headed by Wael Hamza Jalaidan, one of the founders of al-Qaida with bin Laden. He was the logistics chief of bin Ladens organization and fought on bin Ladens side in Afghanistan. Jalaidan himself was branded a Specially Designated Global Terrorist Entity by the United States Treasury Department, and his assets have been frozen, as well. \nStone also contended that much of what the Clintons have done via their foundation is treasonous. \nThey have taken money from the Chinese, the Russians, the Saudis and theyd sold our countrys secrets. Theyve sold our countrys decisions. \nStone delved into some of the emerging details involving Hillary confidant Huma Abedin previously with Breitbart News: Huma Abedin is Vice Chair of Hillary Clintons 2016 presidential campaign. But Huma is more, much more than that. She is the person closest to the most powerful woman in American politics and perhaps the next President. Huma has been described variously as Hillarys body woman, a sort of glorified go-to personal maid, gentle confidant, and by others as an Islamic spy. She may be all of these things, because as we shall see, Huma Abedin has an interesting and complex career history. \nPolitico and several other Beltway media outlets followed up on Stones previous appearance on Breitbart News Daily:  Trump Ally: Clinton Aide Could Be Terrorist Agent : In the wake of Sundays deadly terrorist shooting in Orlando, Donald Trumps longtime friend and informal adviser wants the presumptive Republican nominee to hit Hillary Clinton even harder, suggesting the former secretary of states top aide Huma Abedin could be a Saudi spy or a terrorist agent. Only Trump, Roger Stone said on Sirius XMs Breitbart News Daily, will be able to draw the necessary amount of attention to the theories, which have drawn significant blowback from Democrats and Republicans alike. I also think that now that Islamic terrorism is going to be front and center, theres going to be a new focus on whether this administration, the administration of Hillary Clinton at State was permeated at the highest levels by Saudi intelligence and others who are not loyal Americans, Stone said. I speak specifically of Huma Abedin, the right-hand woman, now vice-chairman or co-chairman of viceof Hillary Clintons presidential campaign.","label":1,"_deepnote_index_column":20737},{"id":20738,"title":"Jackie Mason: GOP Needed 8 Years to Fix Obamacare, Give Me 10 Minutes","author":"Daniel Nussbaum","text":"In these trying times, Jackie Mason is the Voice of Reason.

It is seen by many as the one of the greatest gangster movie of all time and changed forever the image of the traditional justice-seeking hero.\nIt has been a few years at least that I want to share my discovery of this film with our readers. It had a tremendous impact on the way I see the world and the attitude I have towards life. I was convinced of its quality, of the impact it could have on the disciples of the red pill and that a few lines cannot do justice to this giant of Russian cinema culture. It entirely deserves an article of its own.\nMy brother, the criminal \nEnter Danila Bagrov, played by the stellar Sergey Bodrov, who died at 28, at the peak of his meteor-like career. Many called him the Russian James Dean.\nAfter serving in the bloody war theatre of Chechnya, young veteran Danila returns home, in the sleepy provincial town of Tula.\nNeeding money and without any solid prospects, he joins his brother Vytia who works as a hitman for the local well-dressed businessman in Saint Petersburg. Being an expert in making rudimentary weapons and with his quick capacity of reaction and frugality, Danila adapts marvelously to his new occupation.\n\nAfter seeing the risk of a gifted concurrent stealing their livelihood, the citys gangsters soon put a price on his head and send a few professionals to tie up this loose end. But even after being betrayed by a mix of greed and cowardice, young Danila Bagrov decides to take on the mob single handedly.\nAn epitome of the Russian alpha. Hard and unforgiving, sober in words and in behaviour, for whom nothing counts more than the bonds of blood and brotherhood.\nTo err is human \nHis one soft spot is the faith he has in human nature, convinced that if he does good, his fellow man will be virtuous in return. He could not be more wrong, especially with women. He discovers very fast that beta moves like buying them gifts and helping them only brings him trouble or ungratefulness.\nWhat is rare and makes Danila stand out is his loyalty, a cornerstone of the definition of masculinity and a value that progressively vanishes nowadays. His brother will do the unthinkable. But after the storm clears and Danila emerges victorious, he proves once more his quality as a man by being magnanimous and giving him a second chance.\nNo fancy green screen or politically correct themes \nBrat is good because it is painfully real and does not embellish the lawless chaos that was early post-Soviet Russia. This is how it felt when the Wall came down. Everyone was trying to survive the best way they could.\nThe odd, low-quality orange filter used in the film reminds us of this period where everything was made from what people could find when the shelves where empty.\nYou cannot go wrong with a good revenge movie and Danila is an example of bravery. Alone and against all odds, he takes on the mafia that wronged him and will make them pay.\nThe man says it like it is His analysis of the city and its perverse influence on men is brutally accurate:\n\nDanila: You told me about the city, about its strength. But here, everyone is weak.\nHoffman: The city is a great and terrible force. It sucks the life force out of the strong  turns them weak. It takes away your power. And you fell right in the middle of it.\nHis opinion about the abuse of power and the corrupt elites that would kill mother and father for their own profit and the final victory of truth applies especially well to todays political and social context.\n\nAmerican, whats your power? Is it really money? My brother says its money. Youve got lots of money  so what?\nTruth is a real power. Whoever is right is strong. You cheated on a man and took away his money. Did it make you stronger? No, it did not, cause you are not right, and the person you cheated on is. That means hes stronger. Right?\nBrother also drops lethal truths about women and their ways.

They attacked his brothers once more and he will have this time to cross the Atlantic to reclaim what is rightfully his.\nAgain, the movie is realistic, gritty but has a lighter outlook on life. Whereas in the first volume, the main character showed a sheer hatred for everything that came from America and corrupted his country, the sequel that involves Danilas adventures and clueless discovery of American culture often results in hilarious encounters.\nUn film qui prend aux tripes \nIf the red pill was a religion, Danila Bagrov could be its patron saint.

Ten Kushner Scandals: Media Ramp Up Attacks on Presidents Democrat Manhattanite Son-in-Law","author":"Tony Lee","text":"If Jared Kushner did not realize that the establishment press and Democrats will never give him or President Donald Trump a free ride after Democrats politicized Trumps firing of FBI Director James Comey, he is now learning how viciously the antagonistic press can pile on when seeking to destroy their opposition. And it looks like the establishment media are just getting started. [After the Washington Post named Kushner as the person of interest in the FBIs Russia investigation, Kushner, in just a matter of days, as Fox Newss Howard Kurtz wrote, has become the medias biggest target   that is, right after his   .   Kushner may have thought firing Comey would be a win for Trump because Democrats blamed Comey for costing Hillary Clinton the election. But the media never granted Trump a honeymoon period and will not give him automatic wins because they consider him an illegitimate outsider. And, as Kushner is finding out, because he is regarded as Trumps top adviser, Kushner will always be in the medias crosshairs no matter how much he tries to moderate Trump or court and charm the media. After media outlets initially reported that a White House official in Trumps inner circle was a person of interest in the FBIs Russia investigation, the Washington Post last Friday dropped a supposed bombshell report naming Kushner as the person of interest who allegedly wanted a back channel to communicate with Russian officials. But as Breitbart    Joel Pollak noted, nothing in the Posts article was new: The meeting with Kislyak was reported nearly three months ago. The meeting with the banker was reported two months ago. And stories about a potential back channel were reported almost two months ago.  In fact, Kushner is reportedly not even a target of the investigation. There is also no smoking gun proving Kushner colluded with Russia or did anything illegal, for that matter, as former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper emphasized on Sunday. But the media have treated Kushner, like they do with nearly every Republican who does not have favored status with them, as if he is guilty until proven innocent. The establishment press have largely brushed aside the notion that Kushner may have wanted to set up the back channel to discuss Syria policy, especially if he feared that the Obama administration may have been spying on Trumps campaign team. Fox News reported that the idea for a back channel was not even Kushners idea in the first place. The media have also downplayed the fact that Russians often embellish things to engage in disinformation campaigns. Take CNNs report, based on leaks from two anonymous former intelligence officials and even a congressional source, about the Russians having potentially derogatory information on Trump and his top aides. CNN reported that the Russians believed they had leverage on Trumps inner circle, especially regarding financial issues. It is only until after the sensational claims are made that the outlet points out that this information could have been exaggerated or even made up because the Russians could be overstating things. There are certainly more questions that need to be answered   like whether Kushner met with Russian banker Sergey Gorkov as a representative of his private company or as a representative of Trumps transition team. But the controversy surrounding Kushner, which the media have ginned up with their anonymous leakers from the Deep State intent on undermining Trump, has given the media an excuse to damage Kushner politically. As if the media had many of these stories in their back pockets for the perfect time, the media immediately blitzed Kushner with an onslaught negative pieces. Here are ten ways the antagonistic press, with help from Deep State officials, have recently ganged up on Kushner. 1. Romney Redux: Kushner Depicted as Soulless Slumlord, The establishment media never investigated Obamas top confidante and adviser Valerie Jarretts real estate holdings to depict her as a slumlord despite a body of evidence that was right in front of them. But nearly four months into Trumps presidency, the media suddenly had the resources and the wherewithal to find former tenants who lived in Kushners properties to depict Trumps    as a seedy slumlord. ProPublica and the New York Times collaborated on an extensive story about Kushners real estate holdings and depicted Kushner as a seedy and greedy slumlord. The piece was titled, The Beleaguered Tenants of Kushnerville.  They found former tenant Kamiia Warren, who reportedly moved out of her East Baltimore townhouse when a neighbor started acting strangely   like shouting through and banging on the walls at night, which often woke up her child. According to the report, Warren sent a letter reporting the problem to the complexs property manager and submitted the requisite form giving two months notice that she was transferring her Section 8 voucher     the federal   subsidy that helped her pay the rent     elsewhere. The complexs   manager signed the form a week later, checking the line that read The tenant gave notice in accordance with the lease.  Three years later, according to the report, she was sued for $3, 014. 08 by JK2 Westminster LLC, Kushners real estate company, and the lawsuit claimed she owed the money for having left in advance of her leases expiration, though she had received written permission to leave.  The establishment media are at their best when depicting Republicans (or even Democrats like Kushner who are now associated with Republicans) as heartless (see: Mitt Romney). The report points out that Warren was raising three children alone while taking classes for a bachelors degree in health care administration and paints Kushner and his associates as villains who preyed on an innocent single mother. According to the report, Warren lost her first appeal because she did not have a copy of the form the manager had signed. The judge ruled against Warren, awarding JK2 Westminster the full sum it was seeking, plus court costs, attorneys fees and interest that brought the judgment to nearly $5, 000.  Kushners company has reportedly pursued such actions against hundreds of past tenants over the last five years. When Warren could not afford to pay the judgment, Kushners company filed a request to garnish her wages from her   elder care job. Five days earlier, Warren had gone to court to fill out a handwritten motion saying she had proof that she was given permission to leave Cove Village in 2010     she had finally managed to get a copy from the housing department.  But since she did not know that she had to attach a copy of her form to the motion, it was denied. Warrens bank account was ultimately zeroed out and when she returned to court with all of the proper paperwork, her case was reportedly dismissed again without explanation. One of Kushners lawyers reportedly told her, This is not going to go away. You will pay us.  Soon after, according to the report, the court sent notice of a $4, 615 lien against Warren.  2. Kushner Threw Trump Under Bus, Claimed    Thinks GOP Base Is Stupid When a former Kushner employee (  York Observer editor) claimed that Kushner once told her that Trump was promoting birtherism even though he really doesnt believe it because he knows Republicans are stupid and theyll buy it, the press jumped on the comments as proof that Trump is a man with no real morals, no real beliefs, but who is willing to peddle any sort of hatred or monstrous thought if he thinks that it will help him toward the nebulous goal of winning.  3. Media Report Trump Angry at Kushner, Relationship Showing Unmistakable Signs of Strain Though Trump went on the record to publicly support Kushner, the media did their best to undercut Trumps comments with stories about how Trump was losing confidence in Kushners judgment and political acumen. Trump explicitly told the New York Times that Jared is doing a great job for the country and I have total confidence in him. He is respected by virtually everyone and is working on programs that will save our country billions of dollars. In addition to that, and perhaps more importantly, he is a very good person.  Yet, media outlets pointed out that Trump was not that close to Kushner before Kushner joined his campaign and quoted anonymous sources who said that Trump has yelled at Kushner in recent meetings. The Times reported that Trump has even made snide and disparaging comments about Kushners family after Kushners sister reportedly tried to peddle her brothers access in the White House and dangled the availability of   visas to the United States as an enticement for Chinese financiers willing to spend $500, 000 or more to invest in Kushners real estate holdings. 4. Huffington Post: Marrying Ivanka on Calculating Kushners Checklist to Rehabilitate Family Name, According to the   Huffington Post, when Charles Kushner was heading to federal prison in 2005 for illegal campaign contributions, tax evasion and witness tampering, his son Jared got some advice from Howard Rubenstein  the dean of New York damage control  on how to rehabilitate the Kushner name, Charles would later tell a family friend: Step one: Buy a New York newspaper. Dont be too particular, Rubenstein told Jared, according to the family friends recounting of their conversation with Charles. Any newspaper will do. Step two: Buy a big Manhattan building. Any building will do. Step three: Marry the daughter of a rich New York family. Anyone will do. The Huffington Post notes that Jared Kushner went on to do just that. He bought the New York Observer in 2006, made a   $1. 8 billion purchase of 666 Fifth Ave. in 2007 and married Ivanka Trump in 2009.  Whether or not Kushner was indeed working through a checklist, his actions during those years have served him well, the story points out. They also laid the groundwork for the meticulous public relations strategy that has made possible Kushners current paradoxical role in the press, as a blameless yet uniquely powerful member of the Trump administration.  Kushners spokesman reportedly denied the account and Rubenstein told the outlet that the account was preposterous and I never said that or anything like that.  But when it comes to making Trumps    look bad, such a story is too good for outlets like the Huffington Post not to print. 5. Former Kushner Employees Smear Jared: Vindictive Sh*thead Media outlets who were uncurious for eight years about former employees of top Obama administration officials suddenly started interviewing former employees and editors of Kushners newspaper   the New York Observer. Of course, the media found those who were all too eager to smear Kushner. An anonymous editor described to the Washington Post that Kushner was insistent on getting a hit job on a banker who would not help Kushner refinance one of his buildings. Kushner was reportedly still upset when the papers editors   even after assigning three different reporters to find dirt on the banker   decided that theres no story there.  Politico spoke to another former Kushner employee   Harleen Kahlon   who claimed that Kushner asked her to take one for the team and forego her performance bonus based on meeting agreed upon metrics on page views and audience growth. : Kahlon abruptly quit. Ever since, whenever she sees him on TV or on the streets of New York, she points him out to people as: the guy that stole my money. Just before the election, Kahlon described her former boss on Facebook thusly: Were talking about a guy who isnt particularly bright or   doesnt actually know anything, has bought his way into everything ever (with money he got from his criminal father) who is deeply insecure and obsessed with fame (you dont buy the NYO, marry Ivanka Trump, or constantly talk about the phone calls you get from celebrities if its in your nature to shun the spotlight) and who is basically a shithead.  6.   Officials Claim Kushner Guilty of Espionage, May Even Be Russian Agent, Though Obamas former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said that his dashboard warning light was clearly on when he found out about Kushners dealing with Russian agents, he emphasized that there is no evidence of collusion.  But the media rushed to get former Deep State officials who were all too eager to slam Kushner. Former intelligence agent Malcolm Nance suggested Kushner may be guilty of espionage and called for Kushners security clearance to be revoked immediately. Former double agent Naveed Jamali went as far to say he thought Kushner was actually a Russian agent, a comment which even shocked an MSNBC host. 7. Media Suggest Kushner Family Want to Profit off Trump Presidency, Media outlets hinted that Kushner and his family may be more interested in using Trumps presidency to pad their bottom lines and enhancing their images. They pointed to the fact that a day before Kushners sister sought funding from Chinese investors through the   investor visa program, Trump extended the program when he signed the most recent spending bill, raising many eyebrows.  Even the suggestion that Kushner and his family may be trying to profit off Trumps name has made Trump livid, according go the Times. The Times pointed out Kushners sisters   pitch to Chinese nationals violated two major rules: Politically, it undercut his immigration crackdown, and in a personal sense, it smacked of profiteering off Mr. Trump     one of the sins that warrants expulsion from his orbit.  8. Kushner Is Naive, Unqualified and Dumb       Establishment media outlets used comments from former intelligence officials to push the narrative that Kushner was in over his head and naive to handle foreign affairs. When asked about Kushners alleged action, Michael Hayden, the former CIA and NSA Director, told CNN, right now, Im going with navet, and thats not particularly comforting for me.  What manner of ignorance, chaos, hubris, suspicion, contempt would you have to have to think that doing this with the Russian ambassador was a good or an appropriate idea? , he asked. Former KGB spy Jack Barsky told CNN that Kushner was naive and completely unqualified to deal with the Russians because of the inexperience he has in international affairs.  He called Kushners alleged actions  .  9.        Or Maybe Desperate? The Atlantics David Frum suggested that perhaps Kushner was not naive but rather desperate to get financing for his familys Manhattan tower. Maybe Kushner was desperate, not dumb        His family faced a huge hike in its debt servicing costs in December 2016.  Frum wrote. He cited a Bloomberg News report that claimed a Manhattan tower that Kushners family   has been losing money for three years and faces increasing loan fees in 2017, which may explain why the family has been negotiating with Chinese insurance behemoth Anbang on new financing: The fees, at 666 Fifth Avenue, kicked in last month and escalate with each payment until the loan is repaid, a 2011 refinancing agreement shows. December brings another hurdle: Interest paid on the bulk of about $1. 1 billion of loans jumps to 6. 35 percent, more than double what it was after the debt was refinanced in 2011. And as the citys biggest office construction boom in a quarter century creates a glut of supply, the propertys occupancy rates are falling. Seventy percent of the building was filled as of September, filings by LNR Partners, the loan managers, show. This is well below 91 percent for the New York metro area reported at years end by Reis, the   firm, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jeffrey Langbaum. 10. Media: Miserable, Unhappy  Distraught Kushner May Want to Go Back to NYC, After Kushner was named as the person of interest, the media quickly reported that Kushner has been miserable, unhappy and frustrated with his job as he has come under more scrutiny. It is as if they had these paragraphs already written, ready to be fired off at the best possible moment. The Times cited anonymous friends who told the outlet that Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, have made no   commitment to remain by Mr. Trumps side, saying they would review every six months whether to return to private life in New York.  Politico reported that there is a sense of uncertainty about how long Kushner and Ivanka Trump     who associates say likes, but doesnt love, Washington     are planning to stick it out. Some have noted that they rent their Kalorama mansion, which allows them to keep their options of moving back to Manhattan more open.  On Wednesday, the Times reported that Trump has not ruled out the possibility that Kushner and Ivanka would return to New York this year.  Writing in the Guardian, Walter Shapiro predicted that Kushners life in the coming months and maybe years will be a study in misery because he will probably spend more time with his personal lawyer, Clinton justice department veteran Jamie Gorelick, than with Ivanka or his children. Whether it is an appearance under oath on Capitol Hill or the inevitable FBI interview, every sentence Kushner utters will bring with it possible legal jeopardy.  Shapiro, citing Kushners sisters   visa exploits, wrote that perhaps Kushner just calculated that all the hype surrounding his White House role was a     family branding opportunity.  He also suggests that Kushner may end up behind bars, if he is not careful, like his father: the worst thing that can happen to an   real estate investor (as Trump himself knows well) is bankruptcy. When the FBI and special prosecutor Robert Mueller get involved, the penalties can theoretically involve steel bars locking behind you.  If Kushner did not realize it already, he should be well aware by now that the Democrats, the institutional left, and the   establishment media seek to destroy, do not give an inch, and play for keeps. And they may just be warming up.","label":0,"_deepnote_index_column":20742},{"id":20743,"title":"Trump to Seek $54 Billion Increase in Military Spending - The New York Times","author":"Michael D. Shear and Jennifer Steinhauer","text":"WASHINGTON     President Trump put both political parties on notice Monday that he intends to slash spending on many of the federal governments most politically sensitive programs     relating to education, the environment, science and poverty     to protect the economic security of retirees and to shift billions more to the armed forces. The proposal to increase military spending by $54 billion and cut nonmilitary programs by the same amount was unveiled by White House officials as they prepared the presidents plans for next years federal budget. Aides to the president said final decisions about Medicare and Social Security would not be made until later in the year, when he announces his full budget. But Sean Spicer, his spokesman, cited Mr. Trumps campaign commitments about protecting those programs and vowed that hes going to keep his word to the American people.  In effect, Mr. Trump appears determined to take sides in a generational struggle between older, sicker Americans who depend on the entitlement programs, and their younger, poorer counterparts whose livelihoods are shaped by the domestic programs likely to see steep cuts. He also set up a battle for control of Republican Party ideology with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who for years has staked his   reputation on the argument that taming the budget deficit without tax increases would require that Congress change, and cut, the programs that swallow the bulk of the governments spending     Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. I dont know how you take $54 billion out without wholesale taking out entire departments, said Bill Hoagland, a longtime Republican budget aide in the Senate and now a senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center. You need to control it in the area of the entitlement programs, which hes taken off the table. It is a proposal, I dare say, that will be dead on arrival even with a Republican Congress.  Speaking to governors at the White House, Mr. Trump said his spending demands would be at the core of the speech he gives Tuesday night to a joint session of Congress. This budget follows through on my promise to keep Americans safe, he said, calling it a public safety and national security budget that will send a message to the world in these dangerous times of American strength, security and resolve.  In the first part of the speech, Mr. Trump will recount promises made and promises kept, said the aides, who requested anonymity during a briefing with reporters. The rest of the speech will focus on how he will help people with their problems and how he intends to protect the nation. The presidents budget proposals     which were short on detail but are said to exempt not just Medicare and Social Security but also veterans benefits and law enforcement efforts     would lead to deep reductions in federal programs that touch millions of lives. The White House signaled that it would begin with agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency, the Internal Revenue Service and social   programs. A budget with no entitlement cuts and one that does not balance most likely has no chance of passing the House, and could be rejected by Senate Republicans as well. Mr. Trumps proposals are too far to the right in terms of domestic cuts and too far to the left in terms of balance. Their failure could have practical implications for the White House. If Congress fails to pass a budget blueprint for the fiscal year that begins in October, Mr. Trumps promise to drastically rewrite the tax code could also die, since the president was counting on that budget resolution to include special parliamentary language that would shield his tax cuts from a Democratic filibuster. Without it, any tax legislation would have to be bipartisan enough to clear the Senate with 60 votes. But beyond legislative considerations, the fate of Mr. Trumps proposal will go a long way toward determining how significantly his brand of economic populism has changed Republican orthodoxy. Mr. Trump repeatedly said during the campaign that Republican promises to transform Medicare and slash entitlement spending were the reason the party lost the White House in 2012, helpfully   Mr. Ryan, who sat at the bottom of the ticket that year, in his analysis. Social Security, health care and net interest now comprise nearly 60 percent of all federal spending, and that figure is expected to soar to 82 percent over the next 10 years. Paul Ryans budget plans with cuts to Social Security and Medicare are not that popular with most voters, and what helped elect Donald Trump was the promise not to cut benefits and programs, said Douglas Elmendorf, the recently departed director of the Congressional Budget Office and current dean of Harvards John F. Kennedy School of Government. That is an unresolved tension.  White House officials said the broad outlines of a spending plan represented the logical culmination of Mr. Trumps efforts to make good on his campaign pledges to prune what he considers wasteful government spending even as he expands what he considers an underfunded military. It will show the president is keeping his promises and doing exactly what he said he was going to do, said Mick Mulvaney, the presidents budget director. We are taking his words and turning them into policies and dollars.  Mr. Trumps advisers said aid to foreign governments, which makes up a tiny fraction of federal spending, was one such target. The budget for the I. R. S. which was the target of Republican criticism during Barack Obamas administration, would be slashed by 14 percent, according to documents obtained by The New York Times. The Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, which provides grants for community banks and local development, would be all but eliminated. The White House blueprint calls for a 24 percent cut to the E. P. A. s budget, according to a person who had seen the document but was not authorized to speak on the record. That would amount to a reduction of about $2 billion from the agencys annual budget of about $8. 1 billion, reducing its spending to levels not seen since Ronald Reagans presidency. But it is far from clear whether Congress will approve such steep cuts in popular programs. While congressional Republicans have long targeted the E. P. A. s regulatory authority, they are also aware that about half the agencys annual budget is passed through to popular   programs, like converting abandoned industrial sites into sports stadiums and other public facilities, which lawmakers of both parties are loath to cut. And most of the agencys federal office spending goes toward funding programs that are required by existing laws. Last year, even as congressional Republicans railed against the Obama administrations E. P. A. regulations, they proposed cutting only $291 million from the agencys budget. Environmental advocates denounced the proposed cuts, saying they would devastate environmental protection and public health programs while doing little to increase national security. The assault on human health begins now with President Trumps plan to slash the E. P. A. s resources, which are vital to protecting Americans drinking water and air from pollution, said Scott Faber, vice president of government affairs at the Environmental Working Group. But the information to emerge about the budget raises more questions than it answers. Democrats, of course, will be no friend, either. Democrats will make crystal clear the misplaced priorities of the administration and the Republican majority, said Representative Nita M. Lowey of New York, the   Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, and we will fight tooth and nail to protect services and investments that are critical to   American families and communities across the country.  But the budget may be the most striking example in Mr. Trumps young presidency of the ways in which he is challenging the orthodoxy of his own party. Since the start of his insurgent campaign, Mr. Trump has opposed the Republican Partys   positions on a range of policies, including free trade, how to deal with Russia and the future of government entitlement programs. Republicans in Congress had hoped that the influence of the two former Republican House members in Mr. Trumps cabinet     Tom Price, head of health and human services, and Mr. Mulvaney     would have led to new conclusions about the need to address entitlement programs that are swelling drastically with baby boomers retirement. Instead, Mr. Trump appears intent on extracting the savings he needs for military spending from the one part of the budget already most squeezed, domestic discretionary spending.","label":0,"_deepnote_index_column":20743},{"id":20744,"title":"The Battleship Debate","author":"Michael Shrimpton","text":"By Michael Shrimpton on October 30, 2016 Some Battleship Myths Busted \nThe comments on last weeks column (Aberfan  Disaster Or Attack?) threw up some unexpected comments about battleships, and the causes of World War I. As you can tell, it was a wide-ranging discussion! It also showed that that a number of myths about battleships, not to mention the causes of World War I, are still prevalent. First however, some comments on the exciting presidential race. Trump or Clinton? \nIm still predicting a win for Trump. The polls have tightened, which is not good news for Hillary, and the first straws in the wind suggesting a landslide for Trump have appeared. Some polls are still showing a lead for the Democrat, but the most reliable ones seem to be showing Trumpy ahead by 1 or 2 points. \nA delighted Washington Post predicted this week that Trumpy has next to zero chance of winning. Im not sure thats true even if you accept the polls as accurate. The polls are suggesting a tight race. However pollsters have a history of getting it wrong when it comes to races involving conservatives. The margin of error in favor of liberal positions differs from one pollster to another, but between 2.5 and 5% seems about right. \nSince the last two Republican candidates were scarcely conservatives, the reasonably good performance of most polling organisations in 2008 and 2012 has to be viewed with reserve. Polling performance breaks down when you have serious conservative opposition. They can be still an indicator, however, of momentum. The FBI (Photo credit: Hurricane Bianca) \nI have heard of October surprises , indeed the Democrats sprang one over Bimbogate, or at least gave it the good old college try. It might have been better choosing bimbos who had actually met the Republican candidate, or at least met him without witnesses present, but there it is. \nHaving the FBI act with integrity when the suspect is the Democratic candidate for president and polling day is less than two weeks away wasnt so much an October surprise as an October shock, no offense to the Fibbies intended. \nAssuming  just assuming  that this wasnt part of a deal between Mr O and Mr T, whereby Mr T agreed to keep quiet about Mr Os Kenyan/Zanzibari origins in exchange for Mr O backing off the FBI, the timing of the FBIs move was extraordinary. They are saying that it was due to fresh evidence coming into their possession, so it cant have been that. \nIt is just possible that the boys in the Hoover building (thats Hoover as in J Edgar, BTW, not as in the vacuum cleaner) were not aware of the large sums of money slushing, sorry finding, its way to the wife of their Deputy Director from the Clintons. Its a bit of a mystery, and I dont pretend to know the answer. Astonishing as it may sound, with respect, it may even be that the FBI have finally started to act with integrity and good faith. If so, that would be a positive development, although dont expect the CIA to follow suit! If they did, the world really will have turned upside down. The CIA and Wikipedia WWI \nPeople sometimes ask me why I write for VeteransToday, given the lousy pay (!) The short answer is that they are good people and dont interfere with my freedom of expression. VT is also something of an intelligence clearing house, however. I hope readers learn something from my weekly columns (thats why I write em), but I also learn things. \nOne of the things I learnt this week via VT is that the CIA have a thing going with Wikipedia. I thought I was dealing with operatives  it was strange that so-called volunteer editors responded within minutes to any attempt by me to balance the Wikipedia attack piece on me. Turns out the CIA have an active interest in about 10% of Wiki sites, including mine. \nGiven that Director Brennan is an enemy of mine, with Jesuit connections, I helped expose the role of the Jesuit Order in providing the pretext for World War I and the Agency are heavily penetrated by my bitter enemies the DVD, via the Correa/COREA Group in Frankfurt, that would make sense. \nThe next installment in my WikiWar should be mediation. Goodness knows who theyll suggest as a mediator  Angela Merkel probably, or the President of the European Commission. The mediator will definitely be driving a Volkswagen. The Naval Race Rear Admiral Sir Christoper Cradock \nIm inter alia an intelligence historian , so its nice to turn to an historical topic. It is incredibly important to get history right  otherwise we just repeat the same mistakes. \nA number of commenters last week seemed to be laboring under the delusion, no offense intended, that World War I was started by the naval race between the British and German Empires. This nonsensical view, widely propagated since 1918 by German Intelligence and their allies, is still recycled on the BBC and by liberal faculty members, i.e. just about all of them. \nWorld War I was not started by the British Admiralty, nor by accident. It was started by the Germans, who set up the assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his lovely wife Sophie on June 28th 1914. The German army was already mobilising, implementing a war plan drawn up years before. \nThe build-up of the Imperial German Navy had similarly been underway for years, for purely offensive purposes. The German Navy was not designed to protect German interests abroad  its capital ships lacked the range and the habitability for that. It was aimed at bringing the Royal Navys Atlantic and Channel Fleets to battle in the North Sea (the famous Grand Fleet was only formed on the outbreak of war). \nThere is no way the German Navy could have matched the rapid, hemispheric deployment of a battlecruiser squadron to the farthest reaches of the South Atlantic in 1914, e.g., after the destruction of a weak British squadron under Rear-Admiral Sir Christopher Cradock at the Battle of Coronel. Vice-Admiral Sturdees great victory in the Battle of the Falkland Islands was of course made possible by the Naval Intelligence Department. \nThe boys had spotted that the First Sea Lord, von Battenberg, was a German spy and had deliberately refused to reinforce Cradocks squadron. Von Battenberg was left in place and fed false position reports  no wonder the sight of the fighting tops of a British battlecruiser squadron in Port Stanley harbor so rattled the Hun commander, Graf von Spee, who was the runner-up in the battle which followed. The true position was stated millennia ago by the Roman general Vegetius: si vis pacem, para bellum. If you want peace, prepare for war. Great Britain did not encourage the First World War by taking the limited steps that she did to prepare for it. \nWe needed more battleships and battlecruisers, not fewer. Sadly, the Liberal government decided to encourage German aggression by holding back spending on the Royal Navy. Had we been stronger, the Hun would not dare have invaded Belgium and Luxembourg in a flanking attack on the French army. Next Myth HMS Barham \nThe next myth propagated last week was that battleships were vulnerable to U-Boats. The truth is that the only British battleships sunk by U-Boat in both world wars, HMS Barham and HMS Royal Oak, were betrayed. \nRoyal Oak was sunk because the First Sea Lord Sir Dudley Pound was being blackmailed by Jerry and agreed to hold up the badly-needed block-ships requested for Scapa Flow by the C-in-C Home Fleet. \nHad the block-ships been in place, as requested, Gunther Prien wouldnt have got within five miles of Royal Oak. It is not even clear that the dear old Barham was actually sunk in November 1941 by U-331. It is more likely that her magazines were detonated by a radio-controlled IED set off by a German agent on the battleship ahead, which happened to have a cameraman ready to film the sinking. \nAll battleships after the turbine-powered Dreadnought were too fast for submarines, which until the advent of the first true submarine, the German Type XXI, had limited underwater speed and endurance. Forget the headline figure for underwater speed  at top speed a U-Boats batteries would be drained quickly. This made achieving a firing solution difficult. Battleships were also usually too well screened by destroyers. \nThey were such difficult targets that in practice only a U-Boat lying in wait could torpedo them. Then there was the difficulty in sinking them. Older battleships could indeed be sunk by a single submarine, even a single torpedo, ditto battleships whose design was held back by the absurd limitations in the Washington Treaty, designed to make the next world war winnable for the Bad Guys. \nIt is, however, intellectually dishonest to compare the latest subs with older battleships, or battleships, like the King George V class, designed to artificial limits. In World War II modern battleships designed without reference to the Washington Treaty, such as the wonderful Iowa class, incorporated excellent anti-torpedo protection. A single Jap sub, e.g. would have had trouble hitting an Iowa class fast battleship with enough torpedoes to sink her. \nThe King George V classic were a classic illustration of the dangers posed by the Washington Treaty. To save weight their outer prop-shafts werent armored, a weakness which proved fatal when HMS Prince of Wales was struck by a Japanese aerial torpedo in December 1941. In practice battleships were much less vulnerable to torpedo attack than any other type of warship. That is why all Japanese submarine attacks on American battleships in World War II failed, indeed the Japs only ever managed to sink American battleships in harbor in peacetime, and even then they only actually sank two. The other battleships damaged at Pearl Harbor were repaired, modernised and went on to avenge their sisters. Third Myth HMS Repulse \nThe vulnerability of battleships to air attack in World War II has also been greatly overstated. They were of course invulnerable to air attack in World War I, as no aircraft could carry an armor-piercing bomb heavy enough to sink them. No German or Italian battleship was sunk at sea by airpower in the whole of the war. \nNo American battleship was sunk at sea in either war, period. Only one British battleship, HMS Prince of Wales, was sunk by airpower in World War II, and she was betrayed. HMS Indomitable, the carrier designated as her escort, had been run aground, on Pounds orders, whilst working up out of Kingston Harbour in Jamaica. \nAttacking as they did outside fighter range, without combat equipment such self-sealing tanks, the Jap bombers would have been very vulnerable to Indomitables cannon-equipped fighters. \nAs I explain in Spyhunter, Force Zs course had been betrayed to the Japanese in Saigon, via radio, by the German spy Rear-Admiral Palliser. Had Palliser not betrayed the British squadron its unlikely that the Japs would have found them. They had poor air reconnaissance, limited fuel reserves and could not just stooge around the South China Sea trying to find them. \nHMS Repulse was a battlecruiser, not a battleship. Unlike her sister Renown, she had not been modernised. In particular, she lacked Renowns modern 4.5 Dual Purpose (DP) battery, much more effective in the AA role than Prince of Waless DP fit. Bismarck firing at HMS Hood \nHMS Hood , blown-up during the course of the Battle of the Denmark Strait, was also a battlecruiser and, like Repulse, she had not been modernised. The Chamberlain government and the Treasury denied the Admiralty the funds for her much-needed modernisation, precisely in order to make her easier for Jerry to sink. \nAs I explain in Spyhunter, it is very doubtful that Hood was actually sunk by KMS Bismarck and much more likely that she was blown up by an IED in either a 4 magazine, leading to secondary detonation of a main magazine, or a main magazine. \nNone of the broadsides fired by either Bismarck or her accompanying heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen is a good candidate for the alleged fatal shot. Prinz Eugens main battery was only 8/60 caliber  her 270 lb shells were too small to have penetrated Hoods heavy belt armor. \nFor decades, we have been favored with nonsense from pro-Germans about Hoods main deck armor being much weaker than Bismarcks (the true figures are 3 over the magazines for Hood and 4.7 for Bismarck) and Bismarck sinking her with plunging fire at long range. Bismarck, however, was photographed firing at Hood from the Prinz Eugen. As you can see from the photo, Bismarcks main battery is nowhere near maximum elevation. \nThe Hun-loving editors of Wikipedia, BTW, still cannot bring themselves to acknowledge that the Bismarck was sunk by the Royal Navy. She was in fact finished off by torpedoes from the heavy cruiser HMS Dorsetshire, sinking shortly after the last torpedo hit, which Wikipedia would have us believe was a strange coincidence. HMS King George V \nAs I have mentioned, the King George V class , of which Prince of Wales was a member, suffered from design limitations imposed by the Washington Treaty. They also suffered from several design flaws, which would not have been repeated in later classes and partly flowed from the lack of cash given to the Admiralty in the 1930s. \nThey sacrificed AA firepower for spotter aircraft. Whilst the planes were well-protected in an armored hangar, it would have been better to rely on more powerful spotter/recon aircraft flown from escorting carriers. \nThe 5.25 DP secondary armament was an excellent anti-destroyer weapon, probably the best ever deployed on a battleship, but had too poor a rate of fire (around 12-16 rounds per minute) to be an effective weapon against aircraft. The dedicated AA gun, the multiple 2-pounder pom-pom, was the best in the world when it came into service in the late 1920s, but had been overtaken by the 40-mil Bofors. The mounts were not tri-axially stabilized and the class lacked tachymetric AA fire-control. These specific weaknesses however afford no grounds for saying that battleships generally were unduly vulnerable to aircraft. So far to the contrary, they were better able to stand up to bombs and torpedoes than carriers, were more stable gun platforms, had better firing arcs (this was particularly true of the US Navy  the Iowa class had superb firing arcs for their secondary and AA armament, e.g., whereas the firing arcs on the Essex-class carriers were limited) and better fire-control. Unsurprisingly, US fast carrier task forces in the Pacific used battleships to protect carriers against aircraft. HMS Inflexible \nOf the five British capital ships sunk during World War II, two were unmodernised battlecruisers, two were probably sunk by IEDs and all five were betrayed in one way, shape or form. Without the assistance of the Abwehr, including interference by political assets in Number 10, the Cabinet Office and the Treasury with their design or modernisation, probably none of them would have been sunk at all. \nThe US Navy had the right idea. What was needed was balanced all-arms task forces, combining battlewagons, carriers, cruisers and destroyers. Admiral Henderson of the Royal Navy had in fact come up with the idea of fast carrier task forces protected by capital ships in the Mediterranean in the 1930s, but the Royal Navy lacked enough fast battleships and carriers to really make it work until 1945, with the British Pacific Fleet \nOh yes, we were in the Pacific alright , although the lack of defense expenditure and serious planning for war by pro-German weanies in Downing St before the war meant that it took three years for us to get there. Apart that is from our fine armored carrier HMS Victorious, which served briefly in the Pacific in 1943, flying USN squadrons, an episode which would make a fine war movie, if a movie-maker could be found with the guts to make it. \nPresident Reagan also had the right idea in reactivating the Iowa class in the 80s. Had the Royal Navy not been forced to scrap HMS Vanguard, our last battleship, by the German asset Harold Macmillan, it is doubtful that General Galtieri would even have started the war. HMS Vanguard Falklands War \nThe very thought of that elegant and powerful fast battleship , virtually immune from the Exocet sea-skimming missiles (her belt armor was too strong for an Exocet to penetrate) emerging from the gloom of the South Atlantic to pulverise the Argentine Fleet or smash up Argentine forces ashore, would have given the Argies the willies. Vanguards deck armor, BTW, would have been too strong for any bomb the Argentine Air Force could carry. \nNo ship in the Argentine Navy could have remained operational after a single accurate broadside from HMS Vanguard, and she had fully-synthetic fire-control, i.e. could land her main battery guns on target whilst maneuvering. She was a formidable surface combatant. This Weeks Movie Review: Jack Reacher: Never Go Back (2016, dir. Edward Zwick) \nThis movie is huge fun . The first Jack Reacher movie, also starring Tom Cruise, was also huge fun, with the Bad Guys getting whacked all over the place. Its always nice to see dirty cops getting their come-uppance! We could do with Jack Reacher in Thames Valley. No jury would convict. \nUnusually for a sequel, this movie is as good as the original. If anything, its even better. Tom Cruise is excellent as the lead, although it was a disappointment for me that Robert Duvall was not retained. Hes one of my all-time favorite actors. Robert Knepper, as General Harkness, provides strong support, however, as does Cobie Smulders, who I think well be seeing again. \nThe plot, based around bent military contractors, is more believable than most of the anti-military, anti-American rubbish emerging from liberal Hollywood, and the heroes come from the military. The movie moves at a cracking pace, and you are kept in suspense until the end about whether Jack is a father or not. Im not going to spoil it for you by revealing the plot! Its well worth going to see.","label":1,"_deepnote_index_column":20744},{"id":20745,"title":"Thomas Frank Explores Whether Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party Will Address Inequality","author":"nan","text":"Thomas Frank Explores Whether Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party Will Address Inequality Posted on Nov 1, 2016 \nBy KiMi Robinson Robert Scheer and Thomas Frank. \nThomas Franks writing about electoral politics and and its impact on American culture has been published for decades in places like Harpers Magazine, The Wall Street Journal and his 2004 novel, Whats the Matter with Kansas?

Speaker Paul D. Ryan was in a hotel room in Cincinnati last May when he learned that Donald J. Trump     a man he barely knew, with no institutional ties to his party and a mouth that had already clacked his nerves     had secured the Republican nomination for president. Mr. Trump had recently lost the Wisconsin primary, which Mr. Ryan and other Republicans in the state thought would presage the reality television stars demise. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas had made strides, and Mr. Ryan thought the campaign would snake into the summer. But he badly miscalculated. The ensuing path, from Mr. Trumps securing the nomination to Mr. Ryans decision not to have the nominee appear with him at a rally in Wisconsin a month before Election Day, has been jagged and treacherous, marked by brief moments of hope that Mr. Trump could be controlled, followed by the sinking realization that he could not. Mr. Ryan heard the persistent     at times desperate     appeals of Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee and a fellow Wisconsinite, and the angry calls from his rank and file, and neither could move him closer to Mr. Trump. Now, Mr. Ryan finds himself in a singular abyss, desperate to maintain the voter enthusiasm needed to preserve Republican control of Congress, yet unable to defend his partys presidential nominee. If Mr. Trump is defeated on Nov. 8     as Mr. Ryan has all but conceded     but Republicans maintain their House majority, it will fall largely to Mr. Ryan to piece the rubble of his party back together. There is, of course, the question of whether House members would let him do so. The Republicans crisis would have an early reckoning with the House decision on whether the speaker should be Mr. Ryan     whose beliefs in free trade, tolerance toward immigration, changes to entitlement programs and conservative governance have long been Republican orthodoxy     or a new brand of leader who embodies Trumpism. Democrats have moved quickly to paint Mr. Ryan as spineless and calculating for not outright rescinding his endorsement of Mr. Trump, while the right flank in his own party has taken a polar opposite view, saying Mr. Ryan should not publicly criticize the nominee. On Saturday, Mr. Ryans office added to that criticism of Mr. Trump, if indirectly, trying to tamp down the nominees talk of a rigged election. Our democracy relies on confidence in election results, and the speaker is fully confident the states will carry out this election with integrity, said AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Mr. Ryan. For his part, Mr. Trump has been unsparing in his disparagement of Mr. Ryan. Last week, in a series of Twitter posts, he called Mr. Ryan our very weak and ineffective leader, who was lending zero support and should spend more time on balancing the budget, jobs and illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting Republican nominee.  For now, the speaker spends his days treating Mr. Trump like a disgruntled former employee bent on Twitter revenge, essentially ignoring him. Instead, he gives speeches about the   tax credit and the evils of Hillary Clinton, while furiously raising money for suddenly endangered House Republicans. Right now his objective is crystal clear, said Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma, to retain the Republican majority in the House. In that effort he has helped members of the Freedom Caucus as well as those in the Tuesday Group and everyone in between, he said, referring to the most conservative and most moderate members. We will worry about our internal differences after the election. Right now we are in a bar fight and every Republican is worth saving.  That Mr. Ryan and Mr. Trump were never natural allies is understandable. They had met only once before the business tycoon decided to run for the White House, an encounter at a   in New York during the 2012 campaign. Mr. Ryan was Mitt Romneys running mate. Their paths would not cross again. Trump really wasnt on Pauls radar screen, said A. Mark Neuman, a Ryan friend for two decades. Before this presidential race, there was almost no intersection in their lives, he said, noting that Mr. Trump did not share Mr. Ryans passions for the Green Bay Packers, hunting, church, intense workouts and Midwest life with children. The relationship showed strains from the start, with Mr. Ryan alarmed by Mr. Trumps   rhetoric and nationalistic appeals. The speaker decided to offer a policy agenda with no connection to Mr. Trump for other Republicans to embrace, a move almost   during a presidential campaign. If we try to play our own version of identity politics and try to fuel ourselves based on darker emotions, thats not productive, he said. He made calls to several of the Republican presidential candidates to outline the agenda Mr. Trump feigned mild interest but they did not speak again. (The Trump campaign did not return emails with questions for this article. Mr. Ryan also declined to be interviewed.) Mr. Ryan had hoped that Mr. Trump would eventually embrace his plan. When Mr. Trump clinched the nomination in May, Mr. Ryan was rattled, said several people who talked to him that day. The conventional wisdom among the people we talked to here was, Dont worry, this will end, said Charlie Sykes, a former conservative talk radio host in Milwaukee and a friend of Mr. Ryans. So it was a huge shock. I think a lot of us here believed we were going be the firewall in Wisconsin, that there would be an outbreak of rationality.  With campaign rhetoric getting increasingly contentious, Mr. Ryan made the unusual choice of announcing that he was not ready to endorse Mr. Trump. None of this pleased Mr. Priebus, who prided himself on building the modern Republican Party in Wisconsin and longed for unity going into the race against Mrs. Clinton. In text messages and phone calls, Mr. Priebus tried to persuade Mr. Ryan     who was relishing his independence     to accept Mr. Trump, said numerous officials with knowledge of the exchanges who requested anonymity to discuss internal party matters. Mr. Trump would yell at Mr. Priebus and in turn Mr. Priebus would needle Mr. Ryan. When that did not work, Mr. Trump claimed Mr. Ryan had agreed to endorse him before a visit to Capitol Hill to try to woo fellow Republicans, a claim Mr. Ryan viewed as a serious breach. That was the first realization that Trump wasnt just a public persona, said a Republican involved in planning the meeting, who insisted on anonymity so as not to alienate Mr. Trump, but that his staff does not deal in good faith.  In June, after a period of relative silence on Mr. Trumps part, Mr. Ryan finally felt comfortable enough to endorse him. Staff members of both men began to coordinate for the Republican National Convention. But days later Mr. Ryan aggressively criticized Mr. Trump for his remarks about a Hispanic judge. Another outburst, and another brick on the wall was laid. He was genuinely just outraged after all those comments, Mr. Sykes said. A bright spot came in July, when Mr. Trump chose Indianas governor, Mike Pence, who has long been close to Mr. Ryan, as his running mate. Privately, Mr. Pence tried to assure skeptical Republicans that he would impose Mr. Ryans policy agenda if he and Mr. Trump captured the White House. Then in August, Mr. Trump toyed with endorsing Mr. Ryans opponent in a primary. Mr. Ryan, for his part, went on with his summer, serving as the chairman at the convention, where his role was unusually diminished. He watched Mr. Trumps acceptance speech from a sky box. Mr. Trump called Mr. Ryan a handful of times after the convention, once to tell him about his choice of Mr. Pence, and to seek debate advice, which Mr. Ryan said focused on preparation. (Not heeded.) By the fall, Mr. Ryan had basically stopped speaking Mr. Trumps name. The nominee made a request through the R. N. C. to campaign with Mr. Ryan, whose team agreed to invite Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence to an event this month in Wisconsin. Then came the tape of Mr. Trump making vulgar and lewd comments about women in 2005. Mr. Sykes let Mr. Priebus know via text that Mr. Trump was no longer welcome in Wisconsin. Mr. Sykes said Mr. Priebus responded: I am the guy trying to fix this! I am in tears over this.  (A spokeswoman for Mr. Priebus acknowledged that he was upset, but denied any tears.) Mr. Ryan agonized over his options. Ultimately, he chose not to withdraw his endorsement to keep Republicans motivated to vote, which still angered some of his conference. I think they ask far too much of the speaker, said Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah, who has renounced Mr. Trump. His job is to help House Republicans. Period.  Mr. Ryan will soon find out if those members of his party who support Mr. Trump might come after him in the next speaker election. We knew they had extreme views and you kind of rolled your eyes and said they were on our team, Mr. Sykes said. How much damage could they do?","label":0,"_deepnote_index_column":20746},{"id":20747,"title":"Brzezinski: Trump Has ADD or Something, Not Shaking Hands With Merkel Buffoon-Like - Breitbart","author":"Ian Hanchett","text":"On Mondays broadcast of MSNBCs Morning Joe,   Mika Brzezinski stated that she thinks President Trump has ADD or something, and hes just not even there.

Black womens poverty rates are almost five times higher than that of white Canadian women. In Montreal, a 2008 study found that black girls are three times more likely than white girls the same age to have been arrested two times or more. Realities Faced by Black Canadians are a National Shame by Robyn Maynard \nThis article previously appeared in the Montreal Gazette . \n Black Montrealers continue to experience dehumanizing treatment across institutions. \nAfter holding consultations in Quebec, Nova Scotia and Ontario last month, the United Nations Working Group on People of African Descent issued a statement that sheds light on realities, too-often invisible to most Canadians, that should be seen as a national shame. \nThe groups preliminary findings confirm what is already well known in Canadas black communities: that systemic discrimination has subjected black people to racial profiling by law enforcement, soaring incarceration rates, disproportionate poverty and poor health, the over-apprehension of black children by child welfare agencies and lower graduation rates. Black women, they note, face a rate of poverty that is almost five times higher than that of white Canadian women, and are one of the fastest-growing groups in federal prisons. \nUnderlying these injustices, the UN Working Group has made clear, is systemic racism. \nThe UN is right to be concerned, and Montreal is by no means exempt from this criticism: Both its historical and contemporary realities are defined by a systemic anti-blackness that goes too frequently un-named. The enslavement of black (and indigenous) persons was not an uncommon practice in New France, and indeed was legal until 1834. The fact of slavery remains all around us: acclaimed art historian Charmaine Nelson reminds us that many present-day Montreal streets, buildings and institutions are named after white businessmen like James McGill and John Redpath who traded in plantation crops worked by slave labor. \nEnslavement may be over, but centuries later black Montrealers  the largest visible minority in the city  continue to experience dehumanizing treatment across institutions. A 2010 study by sociologists Lonel Bernard and Christopher McAll found that it was over-surveillance, and not the rates of so-called black crime, that accounted for up to 60 per cent of the over-incarceration of black youth in Montreal. \nThe enslavement of black (and indigenous) persons was not an uncommon practice in New France, and indeed was legal until 1834. \nA report commissioned by the Montreal police, leaked to La Presse, found that in St-Michel and Montral-Nord, up to 40 per cent of black youth were stopped in 2006-2007, a rate that indicates a high degree of racial profiling by police officers. Much of this heightened policing was justified to the public as curbing gang activities, when in reality, in 2009, only 1.6 per cent of crimes were gang related. High profile cases of police abuse of black Montrealers and alleged abuse continue to surface, including the recent case of Veckqueth Stevenson, a legally blind black man in his 50s, who has accused the police of using excessive force and unjustly arresting him, ironically, while he was at Nelson Mandela Park. \nBlack women and girls are not exempt, though we hear even less about their experiences locally; the case of Majiza Philip, a black woman who says she had her arm broken by police in 2014, is one example, however. A 2008 study found that black girls in Montreal are three times more likely than white girls the same age to have been arrested two times or more. \nBeyond the criminal justice system, numerous studies have demonstrated that black children are apprehended from their homes by child welfare at alarming rates in Montreal, and this, too, can be attributed to racism. \nThe UN Working group is not the first to point out these injustices, nor are they the only ones proposing solutions. Black Lives Matter-Toronto and other black activist groups in Toronto, Kingston, Ottawa, Vancouver and Montreal have been steadily mobilizing to address anti-black racism. Across cities, black communities have denounced, among other issues, the recent deaths of Abdirahman Abdi in Ottawa, and Bony Jean-Pierre in Montreal, both at the hands of police in 2016. \nIf Canada intends to genuinely reckon with its still-living legacy of black enslavement, the injustices brought to light by the UN  alongside those highlighted by black activists around the country  need to be both addressed and redressed.

Black plastic covered the doors and windows in an ornate suite at one of President Trumps resorts on Saturday, as he bonded with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan over a round of golf on a pristine day. The covering blocked American and Japanese journalists from capturing a glimpse of the leaders on the lush private course in Jupiter, Fla. But Mr. Trumps aides snapped their own picture of the friendly tableau, posting a photo of the men sharing a   with an American flag waving majestically in the distance, to the presidents social media accounts for his millions of followers to see. Having a great time hosting Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in the United States! Mr. Trumps post said. This, after all, was the point of inviting Mr. Abe to his    resort in Palm Beach: a chance to have a   weekend hosting a foreign leader with whom he has said he wants to develop a close relationship. It allowed Mr. Trump to capitalize on some unscripted moments after an initial period in office marred by antagonistic exchanges with some foreign leaders. The news media blackout was nothing unusual in the annals of presidential free time. President Barack Obama routinely played golf out of sight of the press pool that traveled with him, only occasionally allowing a glimpse of him taking a swing or interacting with his partners. But it was the latest reminder that Mr. Trumps presidency is mixing his official role with the business that bears his name. Mr. Abes visit was the first of what Mr. Trumps top aides say will be many in which he uses    the     and   castle on Floridas Gold Coast, as a setting for forging   relationships with important world leaders. That is likely to mean that the property     along with Trump golf courses nearby in Jupiter and West Palm Beach, where the president squired Mr. Abe on Saturday, along with the professional golfer Ernie Els     will draw increased attention and prominence, with all the potential for additional profit that brings.    has doubled its initiation rate for new members, to $200, 000. We got to know each other very, very well on the golf course, Mr. Trump told reporters Saturday evening as he stood beside Mr. Abe and their wives on the way to dinner at   . Nearby, a line of clubgoers in formal wear maneuvered Bentleys and   into the driveway as a full moon rose over the palm trees. The administration said that Mr. Trump was hosting Mr. Abe and his wife as a gift to the Japanese leader and has said that any profits earned from the stays of members of foreign governments at Trump properties during his presidency would be donated to the United States Treasury, to avoid the appearance that he was cashing in on his office. It may be a frequent arrangement. Mr. Trump, his aides say, believes in getting to know foreign leaders with whom he will be spending time and taking their measure in informal settings outside Washington. President Trump is a deal maker, and his coin of the realm is personal relationships and trying to convince people to negotiate a certain way in his favor, so this is what he does, Kathryn Dunn Tenpas, a scholar at the Brookings Institution who has studied presidential travel, said. Mr. Trump is not the first president to make use of a personal retreat to engage in informal diplomacy. George W. Bush hosted foreign leaders at his ranch in Crawford, Texas, while Bill Clinton used Camp David, the official presidential retreat near Thurmont, Md. as an informal backdrop for   diplomacy, including efforts to forge peace in the Middle East. But for Mr. Trump, his retreat is also a   club that benefits his family business, from which he has declined to divest. Its just one more example of using public office for private gain, Richard W. Painter, a White House counsel to Mr. Bush who is an expert on government ethics, said. Hes going to Trump this, Trump that     its clearly designed to raise the value of the brand and send the message to foreign leaders that you ought to patronize Trump properties if you want to get in good with the president.  On Saturday, Mr. Trump appeared to have taken some steps to separate the personal from the political. While Mr. Trump and Mr. Abe shuttled from resort to resort in the armored presidential limousine known as the Beast, the flags that normally flutter on the front and the presidential seals that usually adorn the doors were absent, an indication that these were not official stops. There were other reminders that the visit was unfolding almost exclusively on Mr. Trumps own turf. At the Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, journalists traveling with him were admonished not to take pictures or video. Its a private club, an aide explained.","label":0,"_deepnote_index_column":20752},{"id":20753,"title":"Donald Trumps Self-Funding Includes Payments to Family and His Companies - The New York Times","author":"Alan Rappeport","text":"Donald J. Trump regularly boasts that he is   his presidential bid, but new campaign finance filings show that he is also shifting plenty of money back to himself in the process. According to documents submitted to the Federal Election Commission, Mr. Trump, whose campaign has just $1. 3 million cash on hand, paid at least $1. 1 million to his businesses and family members in May for expenses associated with events and travel costs. The total represents nearly a fifth of the $6 million that his campaign spent in the month. The spending raised eyebrows among campaign finance experts and some of Mr. Trumps critics who have questioned whether the presumptive Republican nominee, who points to his business acumen as a case for his candidacy, is trying to do what he has suggested he would in 2000 when he mulled making an independent run: Its very possible that I could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it.  He could end up turning a profit if he repaid himself for the campaign loans, said Paul S. Ryan, a campaign finance expert with the Campaign Legal Center. He could get all his money back plus the profit margin for what his campaign has paid himself for goods and services.  While most candidates list an array of vendors providing goods and services on their filings, Mr. Trumps is packed with payments to his various clubs and buildings, his fleet of planes and his family. The   billionaire is required by law to account for his spending this way to prevent his companies from making illegal corporate donations to his campaign. In 2015, about $2. 7 million was paid to at least seven companies Mr. Trump owns or to people who work for his real estate and branding empire, repaying them for services provided to his campaign. In May, the   item was Mr. Trumps use of the    Club, his Florida resort, which was paid $423, 000. The campaign paid $350, 000 to TAG Air for his private airplanes, $125, 000 to Trump Restaurants and more than $170, 000 to Trump Tower, the Manhattan skyscraper that houses the campaigns headquarters. Mr. Trumps family also profited from the campaign last month, with his son Erics Virginia wine business taking in about $1, 300. And Mr. Trump, who has said he will not take a salary if he is elected president, paid himself $3, 085 in May. The disbursements are related to travel expenses, according to the filings. Mr. Ryan said that the extent to which Mr. Trump was utilizing his own businesses for his run was unprecedented and that because of his unique financial circumstances, he was wading into territory that went beyond the commissions guidance. We dont have clear answers, Mr. Ryan said. Historically, candidates would separate themselves from their business interests when running for office. Trump has done the opposite by promoting his businesses while running for office.  While candidates often gain recognition from running for president, they are barred from enriching themselves directly from their campaigns. When a campaign buys copies of a candidates book in bulk and distributes them, for example, the candidate cannot accept royalties from the purchases. However, Mr. Ryan notes that the election commission does allow candidates who own commercial property to rent it from themselves at fair market rates, as Mr. Trump has regularly done. Mr. Trumps use of his branded water and steaks falls into something of a gray area. Ciara   an election law expert at New York Universitys Brennan Center for Justice, said that Mr. Trump did not appear to be violating any campaign finance laws, but that he could face more scrutiny over the use of his businesses for campaign purposes now that he is more explicitly asking supporters to donate money to the campaign. It is something to keep an eye on, she said, because as soon as you start using campaign money that has come in from donors, not just the money that he has loaned to himself, and he uses it for something that he will personally keep, or his family will personally keep, that is what crosses the line.  Whether Mr. Trump could end up profiting from his campaign remains a subject of speculation some have questioned if he will eventually ask for the more than $40 million that he has lent to his campaign to be repaid. The eventual effect of the campaign on Mr. Trumps personal brand, which he has said represents a large part of his wealth, also remains unclear. Democrats on Tuesday tried to seize on the payments Mr. Trump made to his businesses as evidence of hypocrisy. Commenters on the liberal website Daily Kos ridiculed Mr. Trump for running a scampaign and overstating the personal investment he was making in his campaign by funneling the money back to his empire. Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee and Mr. Trumps main rival this fall, also piled on, taking to Twitter on Tuesday to jab him over the expenditures and his relatively paltry   sum in one swipe. What is Trump spending his meager campaign resources on? she said. Why, himself, of course.

No More American Thanksgivings by Glen Ford \nThis article originally appeared in the November 27, 2003 , issue of The Black Commentator, which Glen Ford co-founded and edited. \nNobody but Americans celebrates Thanksgiving. It is reserved by history and the intent of the founders as the supremely white American holiday, the most ghoulish event on the national calendar. No Halloween of the imagination can rival the exterminationist reality that was the genesis, and remains the legacy, of the American Thanksgiving. It is the most loathsome, humanity-insulting day of the year  a pure glorification of racist barbarity. \nWe at are thankful that the day grows nearer when the almost four centuries-old abomination will be deprived of its reason for being: white supremacy. Then we may all eat and drink in peace and gratitude for the blessings of humanitys deliverance from the rule of evil men. \nThanksgiving is much more than a lie  if it were that simple, an historical correction of the record of events in 1600s Massachusetts would suffice to purge the flaw in the national mythology. But Thanksgiving is not just a twisted fable, and the mythology it nurtures is itself inherently evil. The real-life events  subsequently revised  were perfectly understood at the time as the first, definitive triumphs of the genocidal European project in New England. The near-erasure of Native Americans in Massachusetts and, soon thereafter, from most of the remainder of the northern English colonial seaboard was the true mission of the Pilgrim enterprise  Act One of the American Dream. African Slavery commenced contemporaneously  an overlapping and ultimately inseparable Act Two. \nThe last Act in the American drama must be the root and branch eradication of all vestiges of Act One and Two  Americas seminal crimes and formative projects. Thanksgiving as presently celebrated  that is, as a national political event  is an affront to civilization. \nCelebrating the unspeakable \nWhite America embraced Thanksgiving because a majority of that population glories in the fruits, if not the unpleasant details, of genocide and slavery and feels, on the whole, good about their heritage: a cornucopia of privilege and national power. Children are taught to identify with the good fortune of the Pilgrims. It does not much matter that the Native American and African holocausts that flowed from the feast at Plymouth are hidden from the childrens version of the story  kids learn soon enough that Indians were made scarce and Africans became enslaved. But they will also never forget the core message of the holiday: that the Pilgrims were good people, who could not have purposely set such evil in motion. Just as the first Thanksgivings marked the consolidation of the English toehold in what became the United States, the core ideological content of the holiday serves to validate all that has since occurred on these shores  a national consecration of the unspeakable, a balm and benediction for the victors, a blessing of the fruits of murder and kidnapping, and an implicit obligation to continue the seamless historical project in the present day. \nThe Thanksgiving story is an absolution of the Pilgrims, whose brutal quest for absolute power in the New World is made to seem both religiously motivated and eminently human. Most importantly, the Pilgrims are depicted as victims  of harsh weather and their own nave yet wholesome visions of a new beginning. In light of this carefully nurtured fable, whatever happened to the Indians, from Plymouth to California and beyond, in the aftermath of the 1621 dinner must be considered a mistake, the result of misunderstandings  at worst, a series of lamentable tragedies. The story provides the essential first frame of the American saga. It is unalloyed racist propaganda, a tale that endures because it served the purposes of a succession of the Pilgrims political heirs, in much the same way that Nazi-enhanced mythology of a glorious Aryan/German past advanced another murderous, expansionist mission. \nThanksgiving is quite dangerous  as were the Pilgrims. \nRejoicing in a cemetery \nThe English settlers, their ostensibly religious venture backed by a trading company, were glad to discover that they had landed in a virtual cemetery in 1620. Corn still sprouted in the abandoned fields of the Wampanoags , but only a remnant of the local population remained around the fabled Rock. In a letter to England, Massachusetts Bay colony founder John Winthrop wrote, \"But for the natives in these parts, God hath so pursued them, as for 300 miles space the greatest part of them are swept away by smallpox which still continues among them. So as God hath thereby cleared our title to this place, those who remain in these parts, being in all not 50, have put themselves under our protection.\" \nEver diligent to claim their own advantages as Gods will, the Pilgrims thanked their deity for having pursued the Indians to mass death. However, it was not divine intervention that wiped out most of the natives around the village of Patuxet but, most likely, smallpox-embedded blankets planted during an English visit or slave raid. Six years before the Pilgrim landing, a ship sailed into Patuxets harbor, captained by none other than the famous seaman and mercenary soldier John Smith , former leader of the first successful English colony in the New World, at Jamestown, Virginia. Epidemic and slavery followed in his wake, as Debra Glidden described in IMDiversity.com : \nIn 1614 the Plymouth Company of England, a joint stock company, hired Captain John Smith to explore land in its behalf. Along what is now the coast of Massachusetts in the territory of the Wampanoag, Smith visited the town of Patuxet according to \"The Colonial Horizon,\" a 1969 book edited by William Goetzinan. Smith renamed the town Plymouth in honor of his employers, but the Wampanoag who inhabited the town continued to call it Patuxet. \nThe following year Captain Hunt, an English slave trader, arrived at Patuxet. It was common practice for explorers to capture Indians, take them to Europe and sell them into slavery for 220 shillings apiece. That practice was described in a 1622 account of happenings entitled \"A Declaration of the State of the Colony and Affairs in Virginia,\" written by Edward Waterhouse. True to the explorer tradition, Hunt kidnapped a number of Wampanoags to sell into slavery. \nAnother common practice among European explorers was to give \"smallpox blankets\" to the Indians. Since smallpox was unknown on this continent prior to the arrival of the Europeans, Native Americans did not have any natural immunity to the disease so smallpox would effectively wipe out entire villages with very little effort required by the Europeans. William Fenton describes how Europeans decimated Native American villages in his 1957 work \"American Indian and White relations to 1830.\" From 1615 to 1619 smallpox ran rampant among the Wampanoags and their neighbors to the north. The Wampanoag lost 70 percent of their population to the epidemic and the Massachusetts lost 90 percent. \nMost of the Wampanoag had died from the smallpox epidemic so when the Pilgrims arrived they found well-cleared fields which they claimed for their own. A Puritan colonist, quoted by Harvard University's Perry Miller, praised the plague that had wiped out the Indians for it was \"the wonderful preparation of the Lord Jesus Christ, by his providence for his people's abode in the Western world.\" \nHistorians have since speculated endlessly on why the woods in the region resembled a park to the disembarking Pilgrims in 1620. The reason should have been obvious: hundreds, if not thousands, of people had lived there just five years before. \nIn less than three generations the settlers would turn all of New England into a charnel house for Native Americans, and fire the economic engines of slavery throughout English-speaking America. Plymouth Rock is the place where the nightmare truly began. \nThe uninvited? \nIt is not at all clear what happened at the first  and only  integrated Thanksgiving feast. Only two written accounts of the three-day event exist, and one of them, by Governor William Bradford, was written 20 years after the fact. Was Chief Massasoit invited to bring 90 Indians with him to dine with 52 colonists, most of them women and children? This seems unlikely. A good harvest had provided the settlers with plenty of food, according to their accounts, so the whites didnt really need the Wampanoags offering of five deer. What we do know is that there had been lots of tension between the two groups that fall. John Two-Hawks, who runs the Native Circle web site, gives a sketch of the facts: \nThanksgiving' did not begin as a great loving relationship between the pilgrims and the Wampanoag, Pequot and Narragansett people. In fact, in October of 1621 when the pilgrim survivors of their first winter in Turtle Island sat down to share the first unofficial 'Thanksgiving' meal, the Indians who were there were not even invited! There was no turkey, squash, cranberry sauce or pumpkin pie. A few days before this alleged feast took place, a company of 'pilgrims' led by Miles Standish actively sought the head of a local Indian chief, and an 11 foot high wall was erected around the entire Plymouth settlement for the very purpose of keeping Indians out! \nIt is much more likely that Chief Massasoit either crashed the party, or brought enough men to ensure that he was not kidnapped or harmed by the Pilgrims. Dr. Tingba Apidta, in his  Black Folks Guide to Understanding Thanksgiving , surmises that the settlers brandished their weaponry early and got drunk soon thereafter. He notes that each Pilgrim drank at least a half gallon of beer a day, which they preferred even to water. This daily inebriation led their governor, William Bradford, to comment on his people's notorious sin, which included their drunkenness and uncleanliness and rampant sodomy. \nSoon after the feast the brutish Miles Standish got his bloody prize, Dr. Apidta writes: \nHe went to the Indians, pretended to be a trader, then beheaded an Indian man named Wituwamat. He brought the head to Plymouth, where it was displayed on a wooden spike for many years, according to Gary B. Nash, as a symbol of white power. Standish had the Indian man's young brother hanged from the rafters for good measure. From that time on, the whites were known to the Indians of Massachusetts by the name Wotowquenange, which in their tongue meant cutthroats and stabbers. \nWhat is certain is that the first feast was not called a Thanksgiving at the time; no further integrated dining occasions were scheduled; and the first, official all-Pilgrim Thanksgiving had to wait until 1637, when the whites of New England celebrated the massacre of the Wampanoags southern neighbors, the Pequots. \nThe real Thanksgiving Day Massacre \nThe Pequots today own the Foxwood Casino and Hotel , in Ledyard, Connecticut, with gross gaming revenues of over $9 billion in 2000. This is truly a (very belated) miracle, since the real first Pilgrim Thanksgiving was intended as the Pequots epitaph. Sixteen years after the problematical Plymouth feast, the English tried mightily to erase the Pequots from the face of the Earth, and thanked God for the blessing. \nHaving subdued, intimidated or made mercenaries of most of the tribes of Massachusetts, the English turned their growing force southward, toward the rich Connecticut valley, the Pequots sphere of influence. At the point where the Mystic River meets the sea, the combined force of English and allied Indians bypassed the Pequot fort to attack and set ablaze a town full of women, children and old people. \nWilliam Bradford, the former Governor of Plymouth and one of the chroniclers of the 1621 feast, was also on hand for the great massacre of 1637: \n\"Those that escaped the fire were slain with the sword; some hewed to pieces, others run through with their rapiers, so that they were quickly dispatched and very few escaped. It was conceived they thus destroyed about 400 at this time. It was a fearful sight to see them thus frying in the fire...horrible was the stink and scent thereof, but the victory seemed a sweet sacrifice, and they gave the prayers thereof to God, who had wrought so wonderfully for them, thus to enclose their enemies in their hands, and give them so speedy a victory over so proud and insulting an enemy.\" \nThe rest of the white folks thought so, too. This day forth shall be a day of celebration and thanksgiving for subduing the Pequots,\" read Governor John Winthrops proclamation. The authentic Thanksgiving Day was born. \nMost historians believe about 700 Pequots were slaughtered at Mystic. Many prisoners were executed, and surviving women and children sold into slavery in the West Indies. Pequot prisoners that escaped execution were parceled out to Indian tribes allied with the English. The Pequot were thought to have been extinguished as a people. According to IndyMedia , The Pequot tribe numbered 8,000 when the Pilgrims arrived, but disease had brought their numbers down to 1,500 by 1637. The Pequot War killed all but a handful of remaining members of the tribe. \nBut there were still too many Indians around to suit the whites of New England, who bided their time while their own numbers increased to critical, murderous mass. \nGuests head on a pole \nBy the 1670s the colonists, with 8,000 men under arms, felt strong enough to demand that the Pilgrims former dinner guests the Wampanoags disarm and submit to the authority of the Crown. After a series of settler provocations in 1675, the Wampanoag struck back, under the leadership of Chief Metacomet, son of Massasoit, called King Philip by the English. Metacomet/Philip, whose wife and son were captured and sold into West Indian slavery, wiped out 13 settlements and killed 600 adult white men before the tide of battle turned. A 1996 issue of the Revolutionary Worker provides an excellent narrative. \nIn their victory, the settlers launched an all-out genocide against the remaining Native people. The Massachusetts government offered 20 shillings bounty for every Indian scalp, and 40 shillings for every prisoner who could be sold into slavery. Soldiers were allowed to enslave any Indian woman or child under 14 they could capture. The \"Praying Indians\" who had converted to Christianity and fought on the side of the European troops were accused of shooting into the treetops during battles with \"hostiles.\" They were enslaved or killed. Other \"peaceful\" Indians of Dartmouth and Dover were invited to negotiate or seek refuge at trading posts  and were sold onto slave ships. \nIt is not known how many Indians were sold into slavery, but in this campaign, 500 enslaved Indians were shipped from Plymouth alone. Of the 12,000 Indians in the surrounding tribes, probably about half died from battle, massacre and starvation. \nAfter King Philip's War, there were almost no Indians left free in the northern British colonies. A colonist wrote from Manhattan's New York colony: \"There is now but few Indians upon the island and those few no ways hurtful. It is to be admired how strangely they have decreased by the hand of God, since the English first settled in these parts.\" In Massachusetts, the colonists declared a \"day of public thanksgiving\" in 1676, saying, \"there now scarce remains a name or family of them [the Indians] but are either slain, captivated or fled.\" \nFifty-five years after the original Thanksgiving Day, the Puritans had destroyed the generous Wampanoag and all other neighboring tribes. The Wampanoag chief King Philip was beheaded. His head was stuck on a pole in Plymouth, where the skull still hung on display 24 years later. \nThis is not thought to be a fit Thanksgiving tale for the children of today, but its the real story, well-known to the settler children of New England at the time  the white kids who saw the Wampanoag head on the pole year after year and knew for certain that God loved them best of all, and that every atrocity they might ever commit against a heathen, non-white was blessed. \nTheres a good term for the process thus set in motion: nation-building. \nRoots of the slave trade \nThe British North American colonists practice of enslaving Indians for labor or direct sale to the West Indies preceded the appearance of the first chained Africans at the dock in Jamestown, Virginia, in 1619. The Jamestown colonists human transaction with the Dutch vessel was an unscheduled occurrence. However, once the African slave trade became commercially established, the fates of Indians and Africans in the colonies became inextricably entwined. New England, born of up-close-and-personal, burn-them-in-the-fires-of-hell genocide, led the political and commercial development of the English colonies. The region also led the nascent nations descent into a slavery-based society and economy. \nIronically, an apologist for Virginian slavery made one of the best, early cases for the indictment of New England as the engine of the American slave trade. Unreconstructed secessionist Lewis Dabneys 1867 book  A Defense of Virginia  traced the slave trades origins all the way back to Plymouth Rock: \nThe planting of the commercial States of North America began with the colony of Puritan Independents at Plymouth, in 1620, which was subsequently enlarged into the State of Massachusetts. The other trading colonies, Rhode Island and Connecticut, as well as New Hampshire (which never had an extensive shipping interest), were offshoots of Massachusetts. They partook of the same characteristics and pursuits; and hence, the example of the parent colony is taken here as a fair representation of them. \nThe first ship from America, which embarked in the African slave trade, was the Desire , Captain Pierce, of Salem; and this was among the first vessels ever built in the colony. The promptitude with which the \"Puritan Fathers\" embarked in this business may be comprehended, when it is stated that the Desire sailed upon her voyage in June, 1637. [Note: the year they massacred the Pequots.] The first feeble and dubious foothold was gained by the white man at Plymouth less than seventeen years before; and as is well known, many years were expended by the struggle of the handful of settlers for existence. So that it may be correctly said, that the commerce of New England was born of the slave trade; as its subsequent prosperity was largely founded upon it. The Desire , proceeding to the Bahamas, with a cargo of \"dry fish and strong liquors, the only commodities for those parts,\" obtained the negroes from two British men-of-war, which had captured them from a Spanish slaver. \nThus, the trade of which the good ship Desire , of Salem, was the harbinger, grew into grand proportions; and for nearly two centuries poured a flood of wealth into New England, as well as no inconsiderable number of slaves. Meanwhile, the other maritime colonies of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, and Connecticut, followed the example of their elder sister emulously; and their commercial history is but a repetition of that of Massachusetts. The towns of Providence, Newport, and New Haven became famous slave trading ports. The magnificent harbor of the second, especially, was the favorite starting-place of the slave ships; and its commerce rivaled, or even exceeded, that of the present commercial metropolis, New York. All the four original States, of course, became slaveholding. \nThe Revolution that exploded in 1770s New England was undertaken by men thoroughly imbued with the worldview of the Indian-killer and slave-holder. How could they not be? The country they claimed as their own was fathered by genocide and mothered by slavery  its true distinction among the commercial nations of the world. And these men were not ashamed, but proud, with vast ambition to spread their exceptional characteristics West and South and wherever their so-far successful project in nation-building might take them  and by the same bloody, savage methods that had served them so well in the past. \nAt the moment of deepest national crisis following the battle of Gettysburg in 1863, President Abraham Lincoln invoked the national fable that is far more central to the white American personality than Lincolns battlefield Address. Lincoln seized upon the 1621 feast as the historic Thanksgiving  bypassing the official and authentic 1637 precedent  and assigned the dateless, murky event the fourth Thursday in November. \nLincoln surveyed a broken nation, and attempted nation-rebuilding, based on the purest white myth. The same year that he issued the Emancipation Proclamation, he renewed the national commitment to a white manifest destiny that began at Plymouth Rock. Lincoln sought to rekindle a shared national mission that former Confederates and Unionists and white immigrants from Europe could collectively embrace. It was and remains a barbaric and racist national unifier, by definition. Only the most fantastic lies can sanitize the history of the Plymouth Colony of Massachusetts. \nLike a rock \nThe Thanksgiving holiday fable is at once a window on the way that many, if not most, white Americans view the world and their place in it, and a pollutant that leaches barbarism into the modern era. The fable attempts to glorify the indefensible, to enshrine an era and mission that represent the nations lowest moral denominators . Thanksgiving as framed in the mythology is, consequently, a drag on that which is potentially civilizing in the national character, a crippling, atavistic deformity. Defenders of the holiday will claim that the politically-corrected childrens version promotes brotherhood, but that is an impossibility  a bald excuse to prolong the worship of colonial forefathers and to erase the crimes they committed. Those bastards burned the Pequot women and children, and ushered in the multinational business of slavery. These are facts. The myth is an insidious diversion  and worse. \nHumanity cannot tolerate a 21st Century superpower, much of whose population perceives the world through the eyes of 17th Century land and flesh bandits. Yet that is the trick that fate has played on the globe. We described the roots of the planetary dilemma in our March 13 commentary,  Racism & War, Perfect Together.  \nThe English arrived with criminal intent - and brought wives and children to form new societies predicated on successful plunder. To justify the murderous enterprise, Indians who had initially cooperated with the squatters were transmogrified into \"savages\" deserving displacement and death. The relentlessly refreshed lie of Indian savagery became a truth in the minds of white Americans, a fact to be acted upon by every succeeding generation of whites. The settlers became a singular people confronting the great \"frontier\" - a euphemism for centuries of genocidal campaigns against a darker, \"savage\" people marked for extinction. \nThe necessity of genocide was the operative, working assumption of the expanding American nation. \"Manifest Destiny\" was born at Plymouth Rock and Jamestown, later to fall (to paraphrase Malcolm) like a rock on Mexico, the Philippines, Haiti, Nicaragua, etc. Little children were taught that the American project was inherently good, Godly, and that those who got in the way were \"evil-doers\" or just plain subhuman, to be gloriously eliminated. The lie is central to white American identity, embraced by waves of European settlers who never saw a red person. \nOnly a century ago, American soldiers caused the deaths of possibly a million Filipinos whom they had been sent to liberate from Spanish rule. They didnt even know who they were killing, and so rationalized their behavior by substituting the usual American victims. Colonel Funston , of the Twentieth Kansas Volunteers, explained what got him motivated in the Philippines: \n\"Our fighting blood was up and we all wanted to kill 'niggers.' This shooting human beings is a 'hot game,' and beats rabbit hunting all to pieces.\" Another wrote that \"the boys go for the enemy as if they were chasing jack-rabbits .... I, for one, hope that Uncle Sam will apply the chastening rod, good, hard, and plenty, and lay it on until they come into the reservation and promise to be good 'Injuns.'\" \nLast week in northern Iraq another American colonel, Joe Anderson of the 101st Airborne (Assault) Division, revealed that he is incapable of perceiving Arabs as human beings. Colonel Anderson, who doubles as a commander and host of a radio call-in program and a TV show designed to win the hearts and minds of the people of Mosul, had learned that someone was out to assassinate him. In the wild mood swing common to racists, Anderson decided that Iraqis are all alike  and of a different breed. He said as much to the Los Angeles Times . \n\"They don't understand being nice,\" said Anderson, who helps oversee the military zone that includes Mosul and environs. He doesn't hide his irritation after months dedicated to restoring the city: \"We spent so long here working with kid gloves, but the average Iraqi guy will tell you, 'The only thing people respect here is violence. They only understand being shot at, being killed. That's the culture.'  Nice guys do finish last here.\" \nCol. Anderson personifies the unfitness of Americans to play a major role in the world, much less rule it. \"We poured a lot of our heart and soul into trying to help the people, he bitched, as if Americans were Gods gift to the planet. \"But it can be frustrating when you hear stupid people still saying, 'You're occupiers. You want our oil. You're turning our country over to Israel.' He cannot fathom that other people  non-whites  aspire to run their own affairs, and will kill and die to achieve that basic right. \nWhat does this have to do with the Mayflower? Everything. Although possibly against their wishes, the Pilgrims hosted the Wampanoag for three no doubt anxious days. The same men killed and enslaved Wampanoags immediately before and after the feast. They, their newly arrived English comrades and their children roasted hundreds of neighboring Indians alive just 16 years later, and two generations afterwards cleared nearly the whole of New England of its indigenous savages, while enthusiastically enriching themselves through the invention of transoceanic, sophisticated means of enslaving millions. The Mayflowers cultural heirs are programmed to find glory in their own depravity, and savagery in their most helpless victims, who can only redeem themselves by accepting the inherent goodness of white Americans. \nThanksgiving encourages these cognitive cripples in their madness, just as it is designed to do.","label":1,"_deepnote_index_column":20754},{"id":20755,"title":"Hillary Clinton Speaks to the Dead For Therapeutic Release","author":"Cassandra Fairbanks","text":"We Are Change \nAs disturbing revelations about Hillary Clintons inner circle come to light thanks to the Wikileaks revelations, it seems like an appropriate time to remind everyone that the former First Lady speaks to the dead for therapeutic release.\n\nClintons bizarre pastime was detailed in the 1996 book The Choice by Bob Woodward.\nSome of the candidates favorite dead friends include Eleanor Roosevelt and Mahatma Gandhi.

The air around the morgue in Mocoa was filled with the smell of the dead, he said, who included his sister and two nephews. Now the bodies are decomposing because they are in open air, said Mr. Estrella, his voice cracking as he spoke by telephone. He was unable to retrieve the bodies, he said the morgue, overloaded with the dead, was understaffed. The bodies were piling up on Monday morning in Mocoa, a Colombian city where mud and debris had made it impossible in places to see that anyone had ever lived there. Rescue workers continued to scour the rubble for the dead. And family members, like Mr. Estrella, pleaded for the bodies of loved ones so they could offer them a proper burial. The provincial capital in the southern mountains of the country was devastated by a flood of water and debris on Saturday that has so far claimed at least 262 lives. The heavy rains caused nearby rivers to rise, generating a torrent that leveled homes and neighborhoods. The putrefaction is beginning, said Nixon Piaguaje, a local radio journalist. Rescue teams, some covered in mud, waded through a landscape of stone and earth in what in many cases had become a search for bodies rather than survivors. Hundreds of relief workers arrived in the town to distribute supplies. President Juan Manuel Santos acknowledged bottlenecks in the relief process, but said more help would be arriving soon and promised a full reconstruction of the city. Edgar Ruiz, an indigenous leader, expressed frustration in a phone interview after trudging through the mud searching for lost members from his community, the Siona people. So far, he said, he had located six families alive from his group, but eight more were unaccounted for. We went to the health centers and the morgue as well, but they were nowhere, he said. Mr. Santos said that at least 43 of the dead were children. We send our prayers to all of them, he said. To their families we send condolences and the sympathy of the entire country.  Colombian television transmitted images of loved ones still searching for lost children in the rubble. I did everything that was possible: I told my son dont let go, and he said he wouldnt, Yuri Narvez told Colombian television station Caracol TV. But the current came and we lost him.  Mr. Piaguaje, the radio journalist, said there were so many bodies that there was no one to bury them all. When someone finds a cadaver, they take them to the cemetery and just leave them there, he said. He said scores of bodies were still lying in open air. On Monday afternoon, Mr. Estrella, the man who was unable to get the bodies of his relatives in the morgue, recalled rushing to the neighborhood of San Miguel after hearing the mudslide to see if his family members were still alive. Instead he looked on as rescue workers pulled out their bodies: First his sister, who lay near the ruins of her home, then her two daughters, one 8, the other just 5 months. He said he had since been haunted by the smell of the dead. You smell it for hundreds of feet, he said. There are people who faint when they open the bags and the bodies are putrefied.

Samuelson","text":"Doctors prescribe deadly opioid for pain-related issues that arent even legal share in: Big Pharma , FDA , Harmful medicine , Health , medical marijuana , Pharmaceutical Drug Addiction \nCorruption. Bribery. Death. All three are examined in various news reports on a little known specialty pharmaceutical company called Insys Theraputics. They are currently under legal fire for Subsys, a controversial sublingual spray that disperses fentanyl, a very fast acting opioid that is 80 times more potent than morphine. The under the tongue delivery allows the fentanyl to bypass the gastrointestinal system and deliver the opioid directly into the blood stream. The Federal Drug Administration (FDA) has ruled that Subsys can only be prescribed to help cancer patients gain relief from sudden spikes of excruciating pain. \nSarah Fuller was a 32 year old woman who suffered from anxiety and fibromyalgia . She didnt have cancer. But that didnt stop her doctor from prescribing Subsys for her aches and pains. The fentanyl acted quickly with Sarahs already prescribed Xanax, a benzodiazepine. She died. Her family is suing the manufacturer. But why did Sarahs doctor prescribe a drug that wasnt approved? Thats easy to answer. Just follow the money. \nAs Stat reports, the sales of Subsys grew to $331 million precisely because physicians give it to patients that dont have cancer, like Sarah Fuller. Doctors get big dollars to simply talk about the drug over dinner, or lunch. Over $6 million dollars have been paid to doctors and health practitioners for this word of mouth activity. \nTake the example of nurse practitioner Heather Alfonso from Illinois. She was paid $83,000 to go to dinner with a few people, and in response, prescribed $1.6 million dollars of Subsys scripts to patients that werent suffering with cancer pain. She didnt contest the allegations against her. \nGetting paid to speak isnt automatically a bribe, but it appears to be a consistent theme when it comes to Susbys marketing methods. Alabama prosecutors built a case against Nancy Reed Perhacs, who used to be a sales representative for Insys Theraputics. Ms. Perhacs coordinated speaking fees for a doctor friend, provided he prescribed Subsys. Her take was $700,000. Other investigations about similar practices are ongoing in Kansas, Rhode Island, New York, Oregon, Michigan, Florida and New Hampshire. \nThe chief executive, founder and chairman of Insys Theraputics is billionaire John Kapoor. Hes been around the block with other controversial pharmaceutical start ups. Kapoor thinks doctors are all ethical. His new FDA approved drug is a chemically created synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) called Syndros. As states legalize the real medicine in cannabis , THC and CBD oil , this is an important pharmaceutical to boycott. \nSources: ","label":1,"_deepnote_index_column":20762},{"id":20763,"title":"The Forgotten Man","author":"Judge Andrew Napolitano","text":"The forgotten man decided the presidential election. Donald Trump persuaded the forgotten man to repose his anger and frustration and power into Trumps hands. Who is the forgotten man? What does he want from government? Why did he vote for Trump?\nWhen the tide began to turn against Hillary Clinton on Tuesday night, I planned to write this column about the unwarranted and unlawful injection of the FBI into the political process. At the time, I was seated with the Fox News number crunchers and generally was exposed to trends and vote totals  and the number crunchers lucid explanation of them  long before they were revealed on-air. I am more an ideas guy than a numbers guy.\nOn Tuesday night, the numbers were so overwhelming it was clear that the FBI had nothing to do with the outcome of the presidential election. The numbers on Tuesday told a tale that needs to be related. What the FBI did and failed to do assaulted the rule of law, but that is for another column.\nWhatever the impression Trump may have given you  a carnival barker, a hero, a jerk, a courageous leader  he brilliantly tapped into a deep vein of millions of American men and women who believe they have been forgotten by the government they pay for. These good people have been alienated by the elites who dominate American government and culture and civic life.\nOn Tuesday night, they found a home.\nThe forgotten man believes that the Obama administration doesnt care about him. The forgotten man knows that the government put into place regulations of economic activity that put him out of work or into a lower-paying job. These forgotten men and women resent the Obama administrations telling them they must have health insurance or they will be taxed for it and then so incompetently manipulating the marketplace as to cause the cost of that insurance  often an unwanted product  to skyrocket.\nThese good folks cringed when their family doctor told them that he could no longer afford to treat them because the feds had over regulated the practice of medicine. They simply couldnt believe that their own government would make the practice of medicine so expensive that doctors in droves could not afford to stay in business. And they were outraged when their doctors told them the feds could see their medical records and dictate their medical treatment.\nThe forgotten man has profound resentment for a government that is telling him how to live. The forgotten mans union dues have shot up. His union leaders use his dues to support political candidates he doesnt know or like. Yet he has usually voted for the Democrats  out of a traditional belief that the Democrats would think of him and his needs when framing federal legislation. They havent.\nThe forgotten man speaks his mind but isnt drawn to lofty arguments about the freedom of speech. The forgotten man wants the government to work but couldnt tell you which aspects of its behavior are unconstitutional. The forgotten man wants elected officials who dont and wont forget him. The forgotten man hopes he never sees a judge in a courtroom, but if he does, he wants to be judged by someone who understands him.\nThe forgotten man wants sexual freedom and privacy, but not babies being ripped from the womb for convenience. The forgotten man doesnt want war but loathes military defeat even more. The forgotten man wants inexpensive goods but will pay more if they are made here by people like him. The forgotten man doesnt want the government to take so much money from those who work hard that they lose their incentive to work or close up their businesses and kill jobs. The forgotten man wants everyone to be able to keep the lions share of what he earns. The forgotten man forgives but doesnt forget.\nTrump got all that. Trump tapped into all that as no presidential candidate had since Ronald Reagan in 1980.\nThe forgotten man viewed Clinton as having no interest in him. The forgotten man believed that Clinton would work for special interests and not for him. The forgotten man saw that what Trump grasped, Clinton overlooked; what Trump understood, Clinton ignored; and what Trump turned into votes, Clinton took for granted.\nI doubt that the forgotten man saw what I did recently. At the Al Smith dinner in New York City last month  a 1,500-person black-tie fundraiser for the Archdiocese of New York at which Trumps speech was mediocre and Clintons was stellar  I tried to shake the hands of both of them but ran into a Secret Service roadblock around the head table. Trump waved to me with a twinkle in his eye. When I saw Clinton, I saw a lonely face without joy. On Wednesday morning, it dawned on me that she was doomed and she knew it.\nThe forgotten man knew it, as well.\nCOPYRIGHT 2016 ANDREW P.

[Sundays conference championship games feature perhaps the NFLs four best quarterbacks this season, Green Bays Aaron Rodgers, Atlantas Matt Ryan, Pittsburghs Ben Roethlisberger and New Englands Tom Brady.  A lot of head coaches and offensive coordinators were fired over the last few weeks. In most cases, they met their end due to the lack of an elite quarterback. In the NFL, its hard to be a great coach or offensive coordinator without a   quarterback. So the four coaches left standing     Green Bays Mike McCarthy, Atlantas Dan Quinn, Pittsburghs Mike Tomlin and New Englands Bill Belichick are four very fortunate men. They have special quarterbacks. So many other NFL head coaches are spinning their wheels because they lack an elite player under center. Sundays two games should be special with this quartet of magnificent quarterbacks on the two fields of action. Here is a breakdown of the NFLs two conference championship games: Green Bay Packers at Atlanta Falcons NFC Championship GameSunday, January 22, 3:05 PM on FOX Georgia Dome, Atlanta, Georgia, This game should be a classic NFL shootout, a   of two   quarterbacks, facing a pair of suspect defenses. No NFL team scored more points this past season than the   Falcons. He threw 38 touchdowns in the regular season, and tossed three more in a playoff win over Seattle. Hes playing the best football of his career. The games other quarterback, Aaron Rodgers, is also playing on a very high level. Ever since his proclamation that the Packers would run the table after starting the season   which they did, hes been tearing up opposing defensive backfields. During the regular season, he threw a remarkable 40 touchdowns, and has added six more in two playoff wins. His interception last week in Dallas was his first in nine games. And Rodgers has destroyed some very good defenses over the last month, putting up 38 points against both the New York Giants and Minnesota Vikings, and 34 last week in Dallas. You could make a strong argument the Falcons defense isnt as good as these three units. So the Packers offense could march through Atlanta like Sherman. But keep in mind, Falcons coach Dan Quinn has a   record against Rodgers, as a defensive coordinator in Seattle and head coach (and de facto defensive coordinator) in Atlanta. So Quinn has a good feel for how to deal with Rodgers. Also, Rodgers currently has the flu, so he might be less than 100 percent during this game. Speaking of health issues, Falcons star receiver Julio Jones isnt 100 percent, dealing with a painful toe injury that kept him out of practice on Wednesday and Thursday. This injury tends to get worse as the game progresses. The Packers also have some question marks at receiver with Jordy Nelson (ribs) Davante Adams (ankle) and Geronimo Allison (hamstring) all   decisions. Expect two of the three to play. On Saturday, the Packers called up WR Max McCaffrey from the practice squad as insurance. This game is too close to call, and could come down to which team has the ball last. Pittsburgh Steelers at New England Patriots NFC ChampionshipSunday, 6:40 PM on CBS Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, Massachusetts, This is the 11th AFC Championship game appearance for Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. If the Steelers hope to keep him from his seventh Super Bowl appearance, they need to duplicate what the Denver Broncos did in last years AFC Championship game, put the Pats superstar QB on the ground a lot. In Denvers   win over New England on January 24, 2016, the Broncos sacked Brady four times, and had 17 QB hits. While it might be hard for the Steelers to duplicate what Denver did since they dont have linebacker Von Miller, their pass rush really improved late in the season. Pittsburgh has won nine straight, and during that streak, theyve have the most sacks in in the NFL. A big reason for Pittsburghs resurgent pass rush was the return of outside linebacker Bud Dupree, who didnt play when New England beat Pittsburgh in Week Seven due to a hernia. The explosive Dupree, and veteran James Harrison on the other side, have been on a tear. They need that to continue this week if the Steelers hope to have any chance at winning this game. Brady was average by his standards in New Englands playoff win over Houston last week, but the Patriots still won by 18. This illustrates Bradys greatness. A pedestrian performance by #12 is still better than most. Pedestrian would be a good word to describe Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger the last six games. In Pittsburghs playoff win over Kansas City last week, they had to settle for six field goals. Maybe his left knee is still a problem. On October 17, he had arthroscopic surgery. And not helping matters for Roethlisberger is Sundays game is on the road. In eight road games this season, Big Ben completed just 59. 4 percent of his passes, throwing just nine touchdowns to eight interceptions. In eight games at home, he completed 70. 8 percent of his throws, and threw 20 touchdowns to five interceptions with a 116. 7 rating. A big reason the Steelers have been able to win, despite less than stellar play from the franchise QB, has been the amazing play of tailback LeVeon Bell, who has emerged as the NFLs best runner. Not only is Bell a great player, but hes playing behind the NFLs best offensive line, which has further enhanced his game. Stopping Bell will be a herculean task for New England. But the Steelers will need more from Roethlisberger than they got last week at Arrowhead Stadium. You can beat Chiefs QB Alex Smith with six field goals, but not Brady. We know that [Brady and Roethlisberger) are Hall of Famers one day, said Steelers center Maurkice Pouncey said. When that type of competition goes head to head against each other, it should be a show out there.  It certainly should be, but its hard to pick against Brady at home in the playoffs. In the   hes   in Foxboro. So there is a very good chance the Patriots win a   game at Gillette Stadium.","label":0,"_deepnote_index_column":20765},{"id":20766,"title":"President Trumps Fathers Day Proclamation: Dads Have Responsibility to Instill in Us Core Values","author":"Penny Starr","text":"President Donald Trump officially declared today Fathers Day and in doing so sent a message about the responsibility fathers have to instill values and set examples for their children.

It is certainly beginning to feel like there must be something going on, since government overreach looks like it is reaching an all-time high across the world.While countries like Australia demonize other nations for their lack of progressiveness, recent developments suggest that its government is taking away people's freedom to think for themselves, slowly but surely chipping away at those who have dissenting opinions. The evidence? The newly released vaccination standards provided by The Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia in response to what the organization described as, \"a small number of nurses and midwives promoting anti-vaccination via social media.\"In their statement, they wrote that the board was merely taking the time to make its expectations in regards to vaccination and vaccination advice very clear to registered nurses, enrolled nurses and midwives. \"The board expects all registered nurses, enrolled nurses and midwives to use the best available evidence in making practice decisions.\"This sentiment might have been acceptable, if it wasn't coupled with the organization also prompting people to tattle on each other. You see, the board is also urging members of the public to come forward and report nurses and midwives who may be expounding anti-vaccination beliefs. Surely anyone who goes against the grain deserves to be punished?If the medical industry was as strictly regulated as it purports itself to be, perhaps so many people wouldn't be dying each year from medical errors. An estimated 18,000 to 54,000 people in Australia lose their lives to medical mistakes each year  but the industry continues to insist that its those pesky thoughts that are really putting people in jeopardy. How dare anyone want to help people and think for themselves at the same time?In their statement, the board noted that any reports will not be taken lightly. \"The board will consider whether the nurse or midwife has breached their professional obligations and will treat these matters seriously.\"To make matters worse, not only will these brave nurses and midwives be reported by people who may once have been their friends or colleagues, but the promotion of what the government deems \"misleading or deceptive information\" is a serious offense.And boy, will they take it seriously. Under national law, the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency is able to prosecute anyone who commits such an act. While we all know that the true deception lies in the promotion of vaccines as a public health necessity, we also know that mainstream medicine will do anything to protect their precious immunizations.Dr. Hannah Dahlen, a professor of midwifery at the University of Western Sydney and the spokeswoman for the Australian College of Midwives, told The Guardian that nurses and midwives are respected individuals who play an important role in society, and that she believes that people take their advice quite seriously. She went on to say, \"I agree that they have a very serious obligation to provide the best available evidence, and it is of course concerning that some are taking to social media in order to express a position not backed by science.\"But are concerns about what's in vaccines really not backed by science? Many people might say that continuing to ignore the evidence that there are horrible toxins like glyphosate and mercury in vaccines is what goes against science .In a rather ironic statement, Dahlen declared, \"The worry is the confirmation bias that can occur, because people might say: 'There you go, this is proof that you can't even have an alternative opinion.' It might in fact just give people more fuel for their belief systems.\"Legislating dissenting opinions into extinction, and persecuting those who are raising awareness about a very real problem is proof that alternative opinions are not allowed. That's really all there is to it; it's biased, unjust and frankly, more befitting of the very governments Australia speaks out against.

[Surprisingly, the document takes aim at political elites for fostering a doctrine of multiculturalism and silence, which can help and facilitate the nefarious ends of   organisation like the Brotherhood.  Somewhat predictably, however, the publication of such claims in Sweden     where open criticism of liberal, multicultural ideals is rare     has caused a row, with critics labelling the report conspiratorial and claiming it misrepresents Islam. Published Friday, the document was commissioned by Swedens Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB) part of the countrys Ministry of Defence, which is responsible for civil protection and public safety. The papers authors claim the Brotherhood is working to increase the number of practicing Muslims in Sweden, encouraging tension with Secular society, and targeting political parties, NGOs, academic institutions and other civil society organisations. They also slam the established structure of values among the countrys political elite [which] places a high value on acceptance and tolerance of citizens who are in some sense different from the mainstream. In the report, the Islamism of the MB is described as a totalitarian political ideology born out of Islam, a religion. This can make it difficult to oppose what on the surface appears to be (a vulnerable minority) religious rights it explains. Critics, therefore, run the risk of being called racist or Islamophobic and because of the situation in Swedish society such classifications endanger peoples careers. The press was quick to label these claims inflammatory, and 22 academics and experts in religion have published a blog post questioning the methodology of the research. The academics     from many of Swedens leading universities     say it is almost conspiratorial to suggest criticism of Islamism is difficult in Sweden. They also insist the claim that the Brotherhood is building a parallel society is refuted in past research. In response to the blog post, the department has refuted the criticism of their methodology, and the reports editor, Magnus Norell, told public service broadcaster SVT: Had they smoked something before they read it? You just need to read the report. If someone doesnt accept this, theres not much I can do about it. Its proven.  Controversially in Sweden, the report also links Islamism and poor social integration to immigration. Islamists aim to build a parallel social structure competing with the rest of the Swedish society the values of its citizens. In this sense, MBs activists pose a   challenge in terms of the countrys social cohesion it states. Adding: Migration from Africa and the Middle East is likely to continue in coming years, both in form of relatives and refugees       Given that MBs goal is to increase the number of practising Muslims in Swedish or European territory, there is a great likelihood that a tug of war will occur between the majority community and the Islamic community with the MBs encouragement       The authors of the blog post objected to this claim. The [reports] authors seem to conclude that Swedish Islam is a homogeneous phenomenon and that Swedish Muslims are led by the Muslim Brotherhood       they write. It is a conclusion that goes against the overall research, which rather points towards the Muslim community being diverse and there being competition between Muslim groups       Founded in 1826, the MB aims to create a global, Sunni Islamic Caliphate by organising Muslims politically. It is arguably the largest Islamist organisation in the world and has links to the Muslim Council of Britain and many other mainstream European Islamic institution. The group has been accused of fostering links to militants and is considered a terrorist organisation by the governments of Bahrain, Egypt, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.","label":0,"_deepnote_index_column":20774},{"id":20775,"title":"How this WWII airman is helping veterans heal with the help of 4-legged friends","author":"Arnaldo Rodgers","text":"  Arnaldo Rodgers is a trained and educated Psychologist.

More Americans are working, and theyre getting paid more money for their efforts. People who werent even looking for jobs now are, and theyre finding them. A blockbuster job growth number for June wasnt downgraded with further analysis, but rather revised higher. Its an election year, which means these numbers will inevitably be viewed through the prism of how they affect the chances of Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump to seize the White House. And to the degree a good economy (and good economic headlines) benefits the incumbent party, theres no question this helps Mrs. Clinton. Political science research particularly points to changes in income as being predictors of how people vote, and the July data on average hourly earnings suggest American workers are being paid more: a 2. 6 percent gain over the last year, tied for the highest since 2009 and a comfortable gain in workers purchasing power in an era of roughly 1 percent annual inflation. So far in the campaign, Mrs. Clinton has resisted crowing about the strengths of the    economy and instead has emphasized her plans to try to strengthen the areas where conditions remain weak. The unemployment rate among adults over age 25 without a high school diploma was 6. 3 percent in July, for example, far above the 2. 5 percent for those with at least a bachelors degree. And while the proportion of Americans who were in the labor force     either working or looking for work     ticked up in July, it has recovered only a tiny sliver of its decline since the 2008 recession (it was 66 percent in December 2007, bottomed out last year at 62. 4 percent, and has recovered slightly to 62. 8 percent). Part of this drop is because baby boomers are hitting retirement age, but some large portion is less well understood, driven by both men and women of prime working age who tell   theyre not even looking for jobs. If you try to search the latest Labor Department numbers for bad news, the closest youll find is a rise in the number of people who have been unemployed for 27 weeks     in other words, people who may say they want work but are becoming increasingly unattached from the habits of holding down a job. So that creates a fascinating backdrop for the economic discussion during the homestretch of the election. The economy truly is growing, and job growth looks to be robust. Expect President Obama and his administration to celebrate (and seek credit for) the good numbers. Expect Mrs. Clinton to seek to show empathy for those who are being left behind even by this stronger recovery and to avoid claims that the economy is as robust as the headline numbers might suggest. And dont be surprised if Mr. Trump repeats his claims that the economy is actually very weak. (He would have been on sounder footing using the poor   G. D. P. report late last week to make that argument, but he was distracted by other battles.) Heres an interpretation of the available data over the last several months that incorporates all these realities. You probably wont hear it on the campaign trail, but if a candidates job was to provide nuance rather than get elected, this is what could be said: The United States economy is creating jobs at a rapid pace most people who say they want a job are able to find one, and employers are having a hard enough time finding workers that theyre having to pay higher wages. But large segments of the population, especially those without advanced education, left the labor force during the last several years, and relatively few of them are being pulled back in by this improving job market. Fixing that will be an important goal of the next president. Meanwhile, for reasons that arent fully understood, economic output is growing much slower than job creation, which will mean lower living standards in the future if that continues. That should be another big worry for whoever occupies the Oval Office in January. Not the stuff of boisterous campaign rallies, but thats what the facts are telling us.","label":0,"_deepnote_index_column":20778},{"id":20779,"title":"Christians in 2017 Most Persecuted Group in the World","author":"Thomas D. Williams, Ph.D.","text":"In many parts of the world, Christians gathering to celebrate Christs resurrection do so with the knowledge that any day their faith could cost them their lives as it has for thousands of their brothers and sisters. [On Palm Sunday, twin bombings by jihadists at two Egyptian churches killed at least 45 worshippers and wounded more than 100 others in the latest of a long string of deadly attacks targeting Christians throughout the world.  The attacks were directed specifically to Christian in their houses of worship to avoid any ambiguity regarding the intent. As has been noted, this was an attack on Christians simply because they are Christians.  On Saturday, the Pakistan military said it has thwarted a major terrorist attack against Christians planned for Easter Sunday after a successful overnight raid just hours after Christians celebrated Good Friday services. On Easter Sunday 2016, an Islamist militant took the lives of more than 70 people and injured over 320 more after detonating his suicide vest in a park in Lahore that was full of Christian families celebrating the feast. Among the victims are more than 30 small children, who at the time of the blast were playing sports and outdoor games in the    Park. During the last calendar year, some 90, 000 Christians were killed for their faith across the globe, making Christians by far the most persecuted group in the world, according to a study from the   Center for Studies on New Religions (CESNUR). The director of CESNUR, Dr. Massimo Introvigne, told Breitbart News that whereas atheistic communist regimes were the greatest persecutors of Christians in the last century, Islamic   has taken its place as the   agent of persecution. The Centers findings corroborate those of other scholars and human rights groups. According to the 2016 World Watch List, for example, published by the Open Doors organization, nine out of the top ten countries where Christians suffer extreme persecution had populations that are at least 50 percent Muslim. Their 2016 report revealed that Islamic extremism is by far the most significant persecution engine of Christians in the world today and that 40 of the 50 countries on the World Watch List are affected by this kind of persecution.  During the year, nearly   of the Christians killed for their faith were executed at the hands of Islamic extremists such as the Islamic State or Boko Haram. While tens of thousands of Christians are killed for their faith, Introvigne said, they are just the tip of the iceberg and much persecution takes place on a daily basis that never makes news. Along with the enormous number of deaths, a great many more Christians   as many as 600 million   were prevented from practicing their faith in 2016. On Easter 2015, Pope Francis reminded the world that there are more Christian martyrs in the present age than even in the first centuries, when the Roman Empire attempted to eliminate all followers of the nascent religion. Calling for tangible help in the defense and protection of our brothers and sisters who are persecuted, exiled, killed, and beheaded just for being Christians, Francis told a crowd of tens of thousands in St. Peters Square that todays martyrs are more numerous than in the first centuries.

She later told the authorities in Florida that she had picked him up from a bassinet, prepared some formula in a bottle and settled back into bed with him, propping him up with a pillow and nestling his head in the crook of her arm. Then she dozed off. Two and a half hours later, according to a Polk County sheriffs affidavit, Ms.   25, woke up in a panic.  Blood was on her baby boy, Javier, who was less than a month old, and vomit was coming out of his mouth, she told officials. Ms.   of Winter Haven in Central Florida, said she tried to revive the boy, and called 911. He was later pronounced dead at a hospital. When investigators interviewed Ms.   about the babys death, according to the document, she said, It happened again.  Prosectors say it was the second time an infant died under Ms.  s care: Her    daughter, Angelina, died of suffocation in 2009. That was ruled an accident. A spokeswoman for the coroners office said Javier also died of accidental suffocation. In November, Ms.   was charged with felony aggravated manslaughter of a child. But the police did not arrest her until Tuesday, after prosecutors reviewed the affidavit and reports. She was scheduled to appear on Wednesday before a judge, according to Polk Countys chief assistant state attorney, Brian Haas. It was not immediately clear whether she had a lawyer. The case touches on a pillar of parenting: how to get infants to sleep, especially for newborns who may require   feedings. It also shines a light on   in which parents share a room or a bed with their infants. The practice is considered controversial for medical and cultural reasons. Family   is common in many parts of the world, but it is generally discouraged in Western cultures, where children traditionally sleep in cribs in separate rooms. Some parents say that   helps to make babies more manageable at night, while others find the constant caregiving and interrupted sleep to be exhausting, a recent study found. Approximately 3, 500 infants die annually in the United States from   deaths, including sudden infant death syndrome, accidental suffocation and accidental strangulation in bed, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. To reduce the risk of those deaths, the academy  recommends positioning of babies supine in bed, using a firm sleep surface, sharing a room without sharing a bed, and avoiding soft bedding and overheating. The   case presents prosecutors with the challenge of showing that   was a form of neglect because the mother had been informed of the risks during both of her pregnancies. These are very, very difficult cases, Mr. Haas said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. We are not charging parents with crimes because accidents happen. There has got to be something more to it.  Mr. Haas said that the case was still in the discovery phase, and officials were gathering more information about what happened in October. The affidavit charging Ms.   said she had undergone counseling during both pregnancies. It said she had received information while she was pregnant with her first child about the dangers of   with babies, and of the importance of placing infants on their backs to sleep. But on Dec. 4, 2009, about two weeks after she had given birth to her baby girl, Ms.   fell asleep while   in bed, only to wake up and find the baby cold and stiff to the touch next to her, the sheriffs affidavit said. The baby died of asphyxia from probable overlay and  according to the medical examiner. When Ms.   learned she was pregnant in 2016, she received training through the Healthy Start program about   and putting an infant to sleep safely, documents show. Her mother and doctor also advised her, the affidavit said. In July, while pregnant, Ms.   was arrested on a charge of possessing methamphetamine, the sheriffs office said in a statement. The felony charge in Javiers death was based on his being killed in the same manner as her first child, Angelina, due to her own culpable negligence and without lawful justification, according to the affidavit. A spokeswoman for the coroners office, Sheli Wilson, said the death certificate called it an accidental suffocation, but she added that an autopsy had not been finalized. Relatives of Ms.   could not be reached for comment on Wednesday.","label":0,"_deepnote_index_column":20780},{"id":20781,"title":"Time is Running Out to Stop Kratom Ban  Need Comments to DEA","author":"Heather Callaghan","text":"By Brandon Turbeville When the DEA announced that it was backing off o f its decision to go through emergency procedures to place kratom on the Schedule 1 list of controlled substances, kratom...

World Heaves Sigh of Relief after Trumps Victory By Finian Cunningham on November 9, 2016 A reflection of how disconnected the political class are from their own people. \nSPUTNIK \nThe election of Donald Trump as the 45th president of the US certainly sent shockwaves around the world. But perhaps the uppermost sense is one of huge relief that Hillary Clinton was kept out of the White House. \nFor most ordinary citizens around the world, Clinton, her multi-billion-dollar election campaign and the fawning corporate media coverage represented everything that is perceived as fundamentally wrong in Western politics. \nHer cronyism goes so far that she would not hesitate to start a world war with Russia, or whoever, in order to appease her corporate sponsors and indulge her deluded notion of exceptional liberalism. \nTrumps stunning victory is a victory for common people and common sense. Despite the Western medias systematic shielding of Clinton from criticism, a good number of ordinary Americans and other nationals around the world could clearly see her irredeemable flaws. \nShe is a self-enriching puppet for Big Finance and the military-industrial complex. And, as her email scandal shows, a consummate liar on top. Donald Trump is a billionaire property tycoon with a big mouth and uncouth manner. He has never held an elected office before. It is unprecedented that he should become the president of the US. \nWill he really make America great again? Will he really deliver on massive infrastructure investments to regenerate impoverished working-class communities across America? We dont know if he just an opportunist conman, or if he really does have a humble heart to reach out to all the forgotten people that he speaks about. One can hope. \nBut one thing is for sure. Trump is no warmonger. And he doesnt seem to be a puppet that can be pushed around. \nWe will deal fairly with everyone \nIn one of the live TV debates with Clinton during the campaign, Trump surprised many viewers when he said, apparently sincerely, that he would never commit a first-strike nuclear attack against any nation. It took a lot of guts and moral integrity to say that. Clinton didnt answer the question, but her past record as Secretary of State shows that she has no hesitation about launching illegal wars and murdering foreign heads of state. \nTrump has also spoken several times about restoring friendly relations with Americas biggest nuclear rival Russia. He took a lot of heat for that from the Clinton campaign and the biased US media, who accused him of being a stooge for Russian President Vladimir Putin. To his credit, Trump did not cave in to the anachronistic Russian baiting, which has been a staple of American politics for decades. \nDuring his acceptance speech as President-elect, Trump repeated his oft-mentioned desire for the US to base its foreign relations on partnership instead of hostility and conflict. \nNotably, Russias Vladimir Putin was one of the first world leaders to congratulate Trump on winning the White House. Reciprocating goodwill, Putin said he hoped to work with Trump so that Russia and the US can restore relations from their current critical condition. \nSurely, this is the point. To replace outmoded ideological stereotypes and animosity with a pragmatic mutual respect to cooperate. \nRussia and its leader are not the enemy of the US, Europe nor the rest of the world  unless you are a terrorist network seeking illicit regime change. Architects of Endless Regime Change wars \nThe people who have demonized Russia are ideologues in Washington and their surrogates among European governments and the Western corporate media. That negative image of Russia does not match reality as ordinary people perceive it, including many ordinary Americans. \nRussia did not destabilize Ukraine. It did not annex Crimea. Russia was not involved in shooting down a civilian airliner. It is not massacring civilians in Syria. In Syria, it is helping a sovereign state defeat terrorist mercenaries in a US-sponsored covert war for regime change. Russia is not a sports-drug pariah. It is not hacking computer systems nor subverting foreign democracies. These are all just false ideological constructs manufactured by the Western establishment and its subservient media. \nOrdinary citizens around the world, especially those in the US, know that. Their real-world concerns are dealing with poverty, unemployment and crumbling societies. This stuff about Putin being the new Hitler and threatening the free world is just so much baloney. \nMaybe because Trump is not a career politician or a Washington insider he knows all that too. And he knows that ordinary Americans are not being listened to by the establishment. Thats why Trumps victory comes as such a shock. \nThe political class have been so wrong on almost every issue, whether it was the Brexit and discontent with the European Union, or foreign relations with Russia, or Trumps chances of winning the presidency. \nThe Western political class have gotten it so wrong on so many issues because it is divorced from the reality as it affects most people. Aloof, elitist, out of touch and undemocratic. \nYet this Western ruling class, as embodied by Hillary Clinton, would be prepared to start even more wars around the world than they already have, based on their own twisted self-serving logic. \nConsider these figures just released by the Pentagon. Under President Obama  who advocated for Clinton  US military exports to Saudi Arabia and other Mideast despots are double the amount under George W Bush. This weapons supply has gone towards arming jihadi terror groups. Clinton approved of this arms bazaar for terrorists when she was in office as part of Washingtons regime-change schemes. \nYet these people like Obama and Clinton spout all sorts of humanitarian and moralistic mumbo-jumbo. They are liars. And they are the most cynical of corrupt politicians. The very breed of politician-puppets that ordinary decent people around the world have come to despise. Americans Not Fooled by Presidential Campaign Tricks \nTrump, for all his personal flaws, is in a different category. He is astute enough to know that the pain of ordinary citizens stems from a badly broken economic system. \nThe main good thing about Trump is that he is a pragmatist who at least appears to be on the side of ordinary people and on the side of restoring peaceful relations with other nations, Russia in particular. \nThe prominent people dejected about Trump are the political class both in the US and Europe and their media echo chambers. \nIt is notable that Germanys Merkel and Frances Hollande both affected an air of disapproval over Trumps victory  unlike Putin who magnanimously congratulated. Hollande said he would be vigilant in his future dealings with Trump. What is he talking about? \nThats why Merkel and Hollande will be next to get kicked out of office in forthcoming elections. Like Obama, Clinton and the American establishment, the pro-US European ruling parties are so out of touch with reality. \nThe demonization of Russia is a reflection of how disconnected the Western political class are from their own people. Ordinary people around the world want jobs, prosperity and peace. They know they cant afford futile hostilities with Russia as have been foisted on them by their rulers, while such urgent social needs go neglected. \nCrazy as it may seem, Trumps win may be a chance for the US to redeem.

Unfortunately, no one can imagine what a free market in health care looks like because we havent had one for nearly a century.  On NBCs Meet the Press this weekend, for example, Chuck Todd told Sen. Tom Cotton that his proposal to create affordable health care that would be widely available, sounds good, but do you understand why some people think thats an impossible promise to keep? (The do you understand       ? formulation is a condescension reserved only for conservatives, whose disagreement with liberals is taken as a sign of stupidity.) Todd continued: To make it affordable, making it wider, I mean, that just seems like     you know, it seems like youre selling something that cant be done realistically.  Dream Sequence: Chuck Todd on Russias Meet the Press after the fall of the Soviet Union: Do you understand why some people think thats an impossible promise to keep? To make bread affordable, making it wider, I mean, that just seems like     you know, it seems like youre selling something that cant be done realistically.  It turns out that, outside of a communist dictatorship, all sorts of products are affordable AND widely available! We dont need Congress to provide us with health care any more than we need them to provide us with bread. What we need is for health insurance to be available on the free market. With lots of companies competing for your business, basic health insurance would cost about $50 a month. We know the cost because Christian groups got a waiver from Obamacare, and thats how much their insurance costs right now. (Under the law, it cant be called insurance, but thats what it is.) Even young, healthy people would buy insurance at that price, expanding the   pools and probably bringing the cost down to $20 or $30 a month. In a free market, there would be an endless variety of   plans, from catastrophic care for the   to extravagant plans for the  . You know     just like every other product in America. You should visit America sometime, Chuck! The orange juice aisle in a Texas grocery store knocked the socks off Russian president Boris Yeltsin. (Imagine how cheap a double screwdriver must be in America!) Just as there are rows of different types of orange juice in the grocery store      and loads of grocery stores     there will be loads of health insurance plans and insurance companies offering them. Americans would finally be able to buy whatever insurance plans they liked, as easily as they currently buy   TVs, cellphones and     whats that product with the cute gecko in its commercials? I remember now! CAR INSURANCE! Evidently, insurance is not impervious to the iron law of economics that every product sold on the free market gets better and cheaper over time. The only complicated part of fixing health care is figuring out how to take care of the other 10 percent of Americans     the poor, the irresponsible and the unlucky. And the only reason that is complicated is because of fraud. Needless to say, the modern nanny state already guarantees that no one will die on the street in America. The taxpayer spends more than a trillion dollars every year on Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security disability insurance so that everyones health is taken care of, from cradle to grave. Unfortunately, probably at least half of that sum is fraud. Policing fraud is difficult because: (1) the bureaucrats dispensing government benefits believe there is no fraud and, if there is, its a good thing because it redistributes income and (2) we keep bringing in immigrants for whom fraud is a way of life. (See Adios, America! The Lefts Plan to Turn Our Country Into a Third World Hellhole. ) Consequently, after the first sentence establishing a free market in health insurance, the entire rest of the bill should be nothing but fraud prevention measures to ensure that only the truly deserving     and the truly American     are accessing   health care programs. Id recommend sending as much as possible back to the states, and also paying bounties to anyone who exposes a fraud against Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security. Anyone caught committing health care fraud should get 10 years. Not in prison, in a Medicaid doctors waiting room. But Im sure you guys in Congress have come up with lots of great ideas for policing fraud in the SEVEN YEARS youve had to think about it. (Hello? Is he breathing? Dammit, Im not getting a pulse! !) Then, Congress can start removing all the bad stuff from the U. S. Code, such as:     the requirement that hospitals provide free care to anyone who shows up (how about separate health clinics for poor people with the sniffles?)     the exemption of insurance companies from the antitrust laws (where all our problems began) and,     the tax breaks only for   health insurance (viciously and arbitrarily punishing the  ). The goal of universal health care is very simple to achieve, just as the goal of universal wearing of clothing seems to have been taken care of. The government can provide for those who cant provide for themselves, but the rest of us need to be allowed to buy health insurance on the free market     an innovation that has made America the richest, most   country in the world. Its taken 50 years, but, thanks to Hillarys losing the election, we finally have liberals on the record opposing the Soviet Union. Cant all of Washington come together and end our soviet health care system?","label":0,"_deepnote_index_column":20785},{"id":20786,"title":"Government Forces Advancing at Damascus-Aleppo Highway in Eastern Ghouta","author":"nan","text":"#FROMTHEFRONT #MAPS 22.11.2016 - 1,361 views 5 ( 7 votes) Government Forces Advancing at Damascus-Aleppo Highway in Eastern Ghouta 5 out of 5 based on 7 ratings. 7 user reviews.

LePage Threatens To Investigate College Students For Fraud If They Vote (VIDEO)","author":"Joe Clark","text":"Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr \nOn Monday, Paul LePage, Maines infamous racist Governor, issued a statement which basically threatened any out-of-state student attending college in his state with an investigation should they decide to vote. \nLePages statement came on the eve of Election Day, and many believe it was designed to scare Democratic leaning college students away from the polls. \nThe governor complained about Democrats encouraging out-of-state students to commit voter fraud by voting in both their home state and the state where they are attending college. He also said that there is no way to determine if a person has cast his or her ballot in two states. \nThe Washington Post : \nDemocrats for decades have encouraged college students from out of state to vote in Maine, even though there is no way to determine whether these college students also voted in their home states, LePage said in a statement. \nCasting ballots in two different states is voter fraud, which is why Maine law requires anyone voting here to establish residency here. We welcome college students establishing residency in our great state, as long as they follow all laws that regulate voting, motor vehicles and taxes. We cannot tolerate voter fraud in our state. \nLePage continued, After the election, we will do everything we can that is allowed under state and federal law to verify college students who voted here are following Maine law, which is clearly displayed on the Secretary of States website. \nHowever, Maines Secretary of State, Matthew Dunlap, says that they do have a system in place to detected that kind of voter fraud, and theyve yet to find evidence of this being a real issue. Dunlap told WMTW ABC 8: \nPeople are not voting in two different jurisdictions. In fact, the Secretary of States office back in 2011 did just such an investigation of over 200 students who were from out of state, and who had registered and voted in Maine to see if they had voted in their home state, and nobody did. \nAlong with the Governors statement, college students at Bates College received a mysterious orange flyer informing them that if they are out of state, students that they must change their drivers license and re-register their vehicle (which the flyer claimed cost usually hundreds of dollars in total). \nThe flyer included an official government website address, as well as references to several state statutes regarding the registration of personal motorized vehicles in Maine. College students in Maine: This flyer is FALSE. You may use your dorm as your legal address to vote. pic.twitter.com/jOE6MvH02s \n Maine College Dems (@MECollegeDem) November 7, 2016 \nTo the average college student, this flyer would probably seem legit. However, as the above tweet states, college students are allowed to use their dorm address as their permanent residence while attending school in the state. \nMaines chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union has requested that the Justice Department step in to investigate. \nThe governors statement seems designed to make college students afraid to vote, Zachary Heiden, legal director at the ACLU of Maine, said in a statement. Voter intimidation and harassment is illegal, and we call on the Department of Justice to investigate the intent of the governors comments. \nCollege students who live in Maine have the right to vote in Maine, and they are not subject to different laws than anyone else. Many of these young people are voting for the first time in a presidential election. The governor should be encouraging that civic participation, not doing everything in his power to undermine it. \nMaines Democratic party is calling this a classic case of GOP voter suppression efforts aimed at minority groups whom they feel will vote Democratic. \nThe false information contained in these fliers is a deliberate attempt to suppress the millennial vote, Maine Democratic Party Chairman Phil Bartlett said in a statement. There is nothing in Maine law that states that college students must change their drivers licenses in order to vote. \nIn fact, the Secretary of States office has made explicitly clear that a dorm can be a students legal voting residence, and that paying out-of-state tuition does not preclude a student from voting. Maine also has same-day voter registration, so students who are not registered to vote in Maine can still register on Election Day. We urge all Bates students to spread the word to their fellow classmates about their voting rights here in Maine. \nDespite their best efforts, numerous states are reporting record turnout numbers, which traditionally doesnt bode well for Republicans who prefer low voter turnout for any group thats isnt non-educated, white, and male. \nFeatured image via YouTube","label":1,"_deepnote_index_column":20788},{"id":20789,"title":"Sen. McConnell: The Supreme Court Vacancy Was Key to President Trumps Win - Breitbart","author":"Warner Todd Huston","text":"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R, KY) recently insisted that the open seat on the U. S. Supreme Court just filled by Justice Neil Gorsuch was a key factor in President Donald Trumps White House victory last November. [Speaking of the the Supreme Court vacancy, Sen. McConnell told the Washington Examiner, At the end, this issue more than any other elected Donald Trump, because, at the end, you had two candidates who were overwhelmingly unpopular.   McConnell noted that blocking President Obamas nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to fill the Supreme Court seat suddenly left vacant after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February of 2016 was important. As Obamas remaining months in office wound down last year, he made the uncommon move of nominating a replacement for Scalia instead of waiting for the results of the   election and allowing the next president to make a nomination. As leader of the Senate, McConnell decided not to allow the Garland nomination to move forward, arguing that since the election was so close, the next president     whether it be Trump or Clinton     should be allowed the nomination. According to McConnell, the possibility that a Republican could get the next nomination energized the drive to elect Trump. Nobody was predicting Trump would get 90 percent of the Republican vote just like Mitt Romney did [in 2012,] but he did, McConnell said. And the single biggest reason was, they wanted him to make the Supreme Court appointment, not Hillary Clinton.  This call was made in February, McConnell concluded. We didnt know who our nominee was going to be yet. What I did not predict was that we would nominate somebody who a lot of Republicans questioned whether he was a Republican. I mean, after all, Donald Trump was having fundraisers for [Senate Minority Leader] Chuck Schumer four or five years ago.  Before his election, Donald Trump met with several groups of conservatives and asked for their recommendation as to whom he should pick for the Supreme Court and then made the unusual move of publicizing his list of possible picks. Trumps move brought in many voices of support for his campaign that he may not otherwise have won.

Human Rights Office for Unfair Bias Against Israel in Latest Report","author":"Adam Shaw","text":"U. S Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has blasted a new U. N. report that attacks Israeli actions in the Middle East, in what she says is the latest sign of the U. N.s unfair bias in how it handles the   conflict. [The report, from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, was submitted in response to a resolution by the Human Rights Council     a body which Haley has repeatedly criticized for its own   bias and the questionable human rights record of some of its members.  The report, titled, Ensuring accountability and justice for all violations of international law in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, evaluates Israels compliance with a number of U. N. resolutions and reports, including demands to deconstruct its security barrier on the West Bank, which has been credited with massively reducing terrorist attacks. The report adds: The High Commissioner notes the repeated failure to comply with the calls for accountability made by the entire human rights system and urges Israel to conduct prompt, impartial and independent investigations of all alleged violations of international human rights law and all allegations of international crimes. Furthermore, the High Commissioner calls upon Israel to ensure that all victims have access to remedies and reparation. The report also notes previous recommendations, including an   boycott call for investigations of the activities of companies and financial institutions profiting from Israeli settlements, and for such practices to be ended and for reparation to be provided to Palestinians affected.  Haley took issue with the reports focus on Israel, noting that it brushed over terror attacks by Hamas and other terrorist groups attacking Israel, and ignored the human rights abuses of other countries. This report is just the latest example of the Human Rights Council singling out Israel rather than focusing on the worlds actual human rights abusers, she said in a statement. Not only does it undermine the credibility of the Human Rights Council on human rights issues, but it once again highlights the unfair bias of the UN when it comes to the   conflict, she said. Haley also took issue with the recommendation that the U. N. General Assembly ask the International Court of Justice to issue an advisory opinion on Israel, something her office says is out of the purview of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Israels Ambassador to the U. N. Danny Danon also condemned the report, saying, This obsession with Israel has crossed all lines.  Danon accused the office of offering to advise and support efforts to create what he called a blacklist database of companies working in the region so that the international community could threaten a boycott. The latest report comes a week after Haley visited the Human Rights Councils headquarters in Geneva and warned that the U. S. could leave the council if it didnt reform its voting and bias against Americas ally in the Middle East. The same week, Breitbart News reported on an upcoming report by the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia and submitted in the name of Secretary General Antonio Guterres, blaming Israeli settlements for a host of Palestinian grievances for everything from excessive use of force to building parks in the West Bank so as to entrench Israels presence.

And this is who is in their corner. \nThe Justice Department official in charge of informing Congress about the newly reactivated Hillary Clinton email probe is a political appointee and former private-practice lawyer who kept Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta out of jail, lobbied for a tax cheat later pardoned by President Bill Clinton and led the effort to confirm Attorney General Loretta Lynch. \nPeter Kadzik, who was confirmed as assistant attorney general for legislative affairs in June 2014, represented Podesta in 1998 when independent counsel Kenneth Starr was investigating Podesta for his possible role in helping ex-Bill Clinton intern and mistress Monica Lewinsky land a job at the United Nations. \nFantastic lawyer. Kept me out of jail, Podesta wrote on Sept. 8, 2008 to Obama aide Cassandra Butts, according to emails hacked from Podestas Gmail account and posted by WikiLeaks. \nKadziks name has surfaced multiple times in regard to the FBIs investigation of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for using a private, homebrewed server. After FBI Director James Comey informed Congress on Thursday the FBI was reviving its inquiry when new evidence linked to a separate investigation was discovered, congressional leaders wrote to the Department of Justice seeking more information. Kadzik replied. \nWe assure you that the Department will continue to work closely with the FBI and together, dedicate all necessary resources and take appropriate steps as expeditiously as possible, Kadzik wrote on Oct. 31. \nKadzik had been an attorney with Dickstein Shapiro LLP for 18 years before he represented Podesta in the Clinton/Lewinsky investigation.

The Indonesian government believes the Islamic State was responsible. [The attack was carried out in the Kampung Melayu area of Indonesias capital by a pair of suicide bombers who detonated themselves about five minutes apart, according to Reuters.  The New York Times noted that the large police presence at the bus station was due to a parade, part of Jakartas festivities leading up to the beginning of the Muslim holiday of Ramadan on Saturday. Another possible factor in the timing of the attack was the formal resignation of Jakarta governor Basuki Ahok Tjahaja Purnama, a Christian of Chinese heritage who is currently serving a   jail sentence for blasphemy against Islam. Ahoks trial and conviction inflamed both racial and religious tensions. He abandoned his appeal against the blasphemy sentence on Tuesday and resigned his office on Wednesday. In addition to the Ramadan parade, the New York Times noted that thousands of   Muslims celebrated the governors resignation on the streets in the hours leading up to the suicide bomb attack. Another theory, advanced on Indonesian television by National Police spokesman Awi Setyono, is that Indonesian extremists might have been triggered by the ongoing clash between ISIS forces and the government of the Philippines, and by the bombing of the Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England. These victims are known to us. They are police. They are bus drivers. They are motorcycle taxi drivers and grocers. I have ordered the police to hunt the terrorists and get to the root of this attack, declared Indonesian President Joko Widodo. Widodo advised citizens to keep calm and keep cool because we Muslims are preparing to enter the month of Ramadan for fasting.  He ordered police to thoroughly investigate the networks of the perpetrators and hunt them to the roots.  Although no group has made a formal claim of responsibility, ISIS involvement is suspected by both Indonesian officials and analysts. The Islamic State remains the main driver of attacks in Indonesia, and the threat posed by militants linked to the group is likely to escalate in the country, Janes Terrorism and Insurgency Center analyst Otso Iho told CNN. Iho noted that experienced militants who fought for ISIS in Iraq and Syria are returning to their home countries, increasing the threat level dramatically. Only a few hundred Indonesians are believed to have traveled to the caliphate to fight for ISIS, but the terror states recruiting efforts in the worlds largest Muslim nation have been disturbingly effective with potential homegrown operatives. Indonesian police said the weapons appeared to be   bombs carried in backpacks. A police inspector said that aluminum, nails, buckshot, and receipts for purchasing rice cookers were found at the scene of the attack. The Associated Press reports that Indonesian   squads raided two houses believed to be owned by the bombers, identified as Ichwanul Nurul Salam, 40, and Ahmad Sukri, 32. Several of their relatives were also taken in for questioning and DNA tests, according to the chief of the   squad. Salams wife reportedly told investigators that the bombs were assembled by another militant known as Agus, who is now sought by police and considered at large and dangerous.  A similar bomb, also believed to have been designed by Agus, was detonated in February by a member of an Indonesian extremist network called Jemaah Anshorut Daulah that has pledged allegiance to ISIS.","label":0,"_deepnote_index_column":20792},{"id":20793,"title":"Idiot Who Destroyed Trump Hollywood Star Gets EXACTLY What He Deserves","author":"Robert Rich","text":"Share This \nAlthough the vandal who thought it was cool to destroy Donald Trumps Hollywood star looked pretty comfortable making a video from the comfort of his own home, that cant be said for him today.

Eastern SATURDAY on ESPN Line: Texans   ( : 37) The Texans were the least inspiring of the N. F. L. s division champions and that was complicated further when Tom Savage, whom the team had elevated to starting quarterback after the benching of Brock Osweiler, was forced to leave Week 17s loss to Tennessee with a concussion. As bad as that sounds, it may still be enough against a reeling Oakland squad that lost Derek Carr to a broken leg in Week 16, Matt McGloin to a shoulder injury in Week 17, and fell all the way from the No. 2 seed in the A. F. C. to No. 5. It is unclear at this point if McGloin or rookie Connor Cook will start at quarterback against Houston. No. 6 Miami Dolphins at No. 3 Pittsburgh Steelers Time: 1:05 p. m. Eastern SUNDAY on CBS The Dolphins were a contender when the teams quarterback, Ryan Tannehill, was lost in Week 14 with injured ligaments in his left knee. Thanks to backup quarterback Matt Moore, and Jay Ajayi, the teams   running back, they won two of three games and secured a   berth. But going up against a   offense like Pittsburgh is a tough test for Miamis middling defense, even if Tannehills knee heals enough to allow him to return. Line: Steelers  .5 ( : 47. 5) Bye weeks: New England, Kansas City With four teams vying for two N. F. C. playoff spots, all eyes were on the   game on Sunday. A Redskins victory could have caused movement in the seedings, with the Lions and Packers playing a     evening matchup. The Giants, who had already locked up the No. 5 seed and had nothing to gain, threw a wrench in the Redskins plans, eliminating their division rivals with a decisive   victory. With the drama essentially taken out of the N. F. C. all of the playoff movement Sunday occurred in the A. F. C. where there was a   at the top of the standings in the A. F. C. West. Just a week after losing Derek Carr, the teams quarterback and a legitimate candidate for most valuable player, to a broken leg, the Oakland Raiders were crushed   by the Denver Broncos. That, combined with the Kansas City Chiefs   victory over the San Diego Chargers vaulted the Chiefs from a   spot all the way to the No. 2 seed in the A. F. C. which comes with a   bye in the playoffs. The loss for Oakland added to the misery of the Raiders, who have gone from Super Bowl contenders last week to a   team that will play on the road in Houston next week potentially with a   quarterback under center as Carrs backup, Matt McGloin, injured his shoulder in the loss to the Broncos. Beyond the switch to the Chiefs as the No.   in the A. F. C. it was business as usual for the teams that will get bye weeks in the playoffs. The New England Patriots secured the No. 1 spot in the A. F. C. with a win over Miami, the Dallas Cowboys were already guaranteed the No. 1 spot in the N. F. C. before their loss to Philadelphia, and the Atlanta Falcons held onto the No. 2 seed in the N. F. C. with a   win over New Orleans. The only remaining chance for a minor   was for the Packers, who led their division by virtue of a tiebreaker, to lose to the Lions, which would have forced them to play on the road in the   round of the playoffs. But the    aspect of the de facto N. F. C. North championship went away when the Redskins lost to the Giants, which eliminated the Redskins from   contention. While most of the races were straight forward, one of the crazier playoff scenarios that had been discussed before the week was the possibility that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers could find themselves in the playoffs. They simply had to shoot the moon by beating the Carolina Panthers, having the Redskins tie the Giants, the Packers lose to the Lions, and should all of that happen they simply required wins by Indianapolis, Dallas, Tennessee and San Francisco to top the Packers in strength of schedule. Tampa Bay took care of their end by beating the Panthers early in the day, but they were eliminated officially when Dallas lost to Philadelphia.","label":0,"_deepnote_index_column":20796},{"id":20797,"title":"Macys Is Said to Receive Takeover Approach by Hudsons Bay - The New York Times","author":"Michael J. de la Merced and Rachel Abrams","text":"The Macys of today grew from the union of several great names in American retailing, including its namesake chain, Bloomingdales and Marshall Fields. But the ambitious owner of Saks Fifth Avenue has broached the idea of taking the union even further, combining with Macys to create a department store juggernaut at a time when the industry is reeling. Hudsons Bay Company, the Canadian owner of Saks, has approached Macys about a potential takeover, people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly said on Friday. Talks between the two companies are at an early stage and may still fall apart or lead to a partnership of some kind rather than a sale. While it is unclear whether a deal will happen, a combination could lift the fortunes of Macys, the countrys biggest department store, which has been struggling. Investors certainly appeared to see it that way. Shares of Macys rose as much as 12 percent on Friday, its biggest intraday gain since Aug. 11, according to data from Bloomberg. Once a retail titan, Macys has struggled to remain relevant as   and discount retailers have decimated the traditional    business. Last month, Macys announced plans to cut more than 10, 000 jobs and close some of its 880 stores. Terry Lundgren, its chief executive and the architect of Macys last big merger, is expected to step down by the end of March. He will be succeeded by the companys president, Jeffrey Gennette. Since the recession, shoppers have grown accustomed to hunt for bargains and to not pay full price. Discount stores and outlet malls have flourished. Traditional stores have been compelled to respond by trimming prices, which cuts into their margins. Departments stores have been hit especially hard, particularly as shoppers migrate away from malls. What has emerged, analysts say, is a virtual race to the bottom. That has been particularly difficult for Macys, born of a series of mergers over the past two decades that made it a juggernaut in the industry. A stalwart of the middle tier of retail, the company has neither the advantages of   retailers like HM nor the   stores. In addition, Macys faces increasingly fierce competition online from sites like Amazon and elsewhere. Macys troubles have drawn the attention of a prominent activist hedge fund, Starboard Value, which has urged the company to generate cash by selling the real estate beneath its stores. Starboard, which held just under 1 percent of Macys shares as of Sept. 30, had previously estimated the value of that land at about $21 billion. On Friday, analysts at Citigroup estimated that Macys   holdings could be worth at least $18 billion. Macys market value, by comparison, was just under $11 billion as of Friday morning. Macys has taken some steps to sell or redevelop stores, and last year, it added an expert on real estate transactions to its board. But the company has largely resisted more ambitious efforts to divest its real estate, including     deals, in which a company sells the underlying land beneath its stores and then rents it back. The companys suitor, Hudsons Bay Company, is far smaller     its market value was about 1. 9 billion Canadian dollars, or $1. 5 billion     but is known for its bold steps. Hudsons Bay Company has assembled a growing empire that includes the Hudsons Bay department store chain, Lord  Taylor and its crown jewel, Saks. And the governor and executive chairman of the Hudsons Bay Company, Richard Baker, has shown little fear of using debt: In November 2014, the company borrowed nearly $4 billion against the Saks flagship in Midtown Manhattan. He has spoken often of retailers need to highlight the value of their real estate. Financing a bid for Macys may be trickier, however, because the it carries about $6. 5 billion in   debt. That may mean that the Hudsons Bay Company will have to bring in a partner or borrow against more of its real estate holdings. A spokesman for the Hudsons Bay Company declined to comment on the talks, which were reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal. We do not comment on rumors and speculation, a representative for Macys said. A representative for Starboard Value did not respond to a request for comment. Some analysts said that they saw the merit of a potential combination, particularly given Macys operational woes and Mr. Bakers expertise in wringing money out of real estate. There is a clear logic, despite disparity in   cap between Macys and Hudsons Bay Company, Craig Johnson, the president of Customer Growth Partners, a research firm, said in a note. Referring to Macys stock ticker symbol, he added, The retail market has been changing faster than M has been able to keep up with, whether the flight from the mall or the migration online.

It will involve 680 unarmed personnel from seven NATO countries and 10 partner states. \nIn the past both Serbia and Montenegro were constitutional republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. \nBoth countries are socialist republics and traditional Russian Christian Orthodox allies. In 2003 this state union was re-formed into Serbia and Montenegro, and in 2006 the two became independent states. \nSince their split, the two Balkan neighbors seem to have headed in different directions strategically. \nMontenegro has taken a pro-Western stance which has been awarded by NATO with an offer to join the Northern Atlantic Alliance. \nThe NATO invitation to Montenegro has met strong opposition from Russia. \nMeanwhile, Montenegrin officials have accused Russia of staging an alleged coup in October to topple its pro-Western government because of the NATO accession bid. \nSerbia, a NATO partner, has held exercises with the Western alliance, but not such a large one or with foreign troops and equipment participating on its soil.","label":1,"_deepnote_index_column":20798},{"id":20799,"title":"What Keeps the F-35 Alive","author":"David Swanson","text":"  David Swanson is an author, activist, journalist, and radio host.

What Keeps the F-35 Alive By David Swanson on October 31, 2016 Petition to Stop F-35 Going Global \nby David Swanson \nImagine if a local business in your town invented a brand new tool that was intended to have an almost magical effect thousands of miles away. However, where the tool was kept and used locally became an area unsafe for children. Children who got near this tool tended to have increased blood pressure and increased stress hormones, lower reading skills, poorer memories, impaired auditory and speech perception, and impaired academic performance. \nMost of us would find this situation at least a little concerning, unless the new invention was designed to murder lots of people. Then itd be just fine. \nNow, imagine if this same new tool ruined neighborhoods because people couldnt safely live near it. Imagine if the government had to compensate people but kick them out of living near the location of this tool. Again, I think, we might find that troubling if mass murder were not the mission. \nImagine also that this tool fairly frequently explodes, emitting highly toxic chemicals, particles, and fibers unsafe to breathe into the air for miles around. Normally, thatd be a problem. But if this tool is needed for killing lots of people, well work with its flaws, wont we? \nNow, what if this new gadget was expected to cost at least $1,400,000,000,000 over 50 years? And what if that money had to be taken away from numerous other expenses more beneficial for the economy and the world? What if the $1.4 trillion was drained out of the economy causing a loss of jobs and a radical diminuition of resources for education, healthcare, housing, environmental protection, or humanitarian aid? Wouldnt that be a worry in some cases, I mean in those cases where the ability to kill tons of human beings wasnt at stake? \nWhat if this product, even when working perfectly, was a leading destroyer of the earths natural environment? \nWhat if this high-tech toy wasnt even designed to do what was expected of it and wasnt even able to do what it was designed for? \nAmazingly, even those shortcomings do not matter as long as the intention is massive murder and destruction. Then, all is forgiven. \nThe tool Im describing is called the F-35. At RootsAction.org you can find a new petition launched by locally-minded people acting globally in places where the F-35 is intended to be based. Also at that link youll find explanations of how the tool Ive been decribing is the F-35. \nThe petition is directed to the United States Congress and the governments of Australia, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Israel, Japan and South Korea from the world and from the people of Burlington, Vermont, and Fairbanks, Alaska, where the F-35 is to be based. This effort is being initiated by Vermont Stop the F35 Coalition, Save Our Skies Vermont, Western Maine Matters, Alaska Peace Center, University of Alaska Fairbanks Peace Club, North Star Chapter 146 Veterans For Peace, World Beyond War, RootsAction.org, Code Pink, and Ben Cohen. \nThe petition reads: \nThe F-35 is a weapon of offensive war, serving no defensive purpose. It is planned to cost the U.S. $1.4 trillion over 50 years. Because starvation on earth could be ended for $30 billion and the lack of clean drinking water for $11 billion per year, it is first and foremost through the wasting of resources that this airplane will kill. Military spending, contrary to popular misconception, also hurts the U.S. economy ( see here ) and other economies. The F-35 causes negative health impacts and cognitive impairment in children living near its bases. It renders housing near airports unsuitable for residential use. It has a high crash rate and horrible consequences to those living in the area of its crashes. Its emissions are a major environmental polluter. \nWars are endangering the United States and other participating nations rather than protecting them. Nonviolent tools of law, diplomacy, aid, crisis prevention, and verifiable nuclear disarmament should be substituted for continuing counterproductive wars. Therefore, we, the undersigned, call for the immediate cancellation of the F-35 program as a whole, and the immediate cancellation of plans to base any such dangerous and noisy jets near populated areas. We oppose replacing the F-35 with any other weapon or basing the F-35 in any other locations. We further demand redirection of the money for the F-35 back into taxpayers pockets, and into environmental and human needs in the U.S., other F-35 customer nations, and around the world, including to fight climate change, pay off student debt, rebuild crumbling infrastructure, and improve education, healthcare, and housing. \nAdd your name . \nDavid Swanson is an author, activist, journalist, and radio host.
